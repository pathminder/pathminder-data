## Contributing

Pull requests are great, but make sure anything you want to contribute is under the OGL.

1. Fork the repo, then clone it.

2. Make your changes in the data.

3. Push to your fork and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/pathminder/pathminder-data/compare/).

All contributions should have a linked source with an OGL notice, Section 15 entry, and any other legalities covered. We don't want to end up with "orphan" content that only exists on the Pathminder site or that has OGL status in doubt.

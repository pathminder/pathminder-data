  This inky paste aids unskilled poison-users. When smeared on the fingers, a dose of blackfingers paste prevents accidental poisoning while applying poison to a weapon, as if the user possessed the poison use ability. A single dose of blackfingers paste lasts for 1d6 hours, but the black stains the stuff creates on the userâ€™s fingers lasts for days. A single dose of this alchemical item costs 50 gp.

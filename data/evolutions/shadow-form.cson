  The eidolon's body becomes shadowy and more indistinct. This shadow form grants the eidolon constant concealment (20% miss chance), and its melee attacks affect incorporeal creatures as if it had the *ghost touch* weapon property. The eidolon's melee attacks deal only half damage to corporeal creatures.

text: '''
  The effects of the smoke created by an alchemist's bomb duplicates the effects of [*greater contagion*](/spells/greater-contagion/) instead of [*fog cloud*](/spells/fog-cloud/), filling an area equal to twice the bomb's splash radius for 1 round per level. An alchemist must possess the plague bomb and smoke bomb discoveries before selecting this discovery.

text: '''
  When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it suppress light sources on the target. This extinguishes nonmagical light sources carried by the target and dispels magical light sources for 1 round/level as [*deeper darkness*](/spells/deeper-darkness/).

  This discovery doesn't stack with other discoveries that modify bombs.

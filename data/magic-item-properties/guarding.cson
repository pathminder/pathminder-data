text: '''
  A *guarding* shield allows the wearer to transfer some or all of the shield's enhancement bonus to an adjacent creature's AC (this bonus stacks with all others). As a free action at the start of her turn before using any of the shield's other abilities, the wearer may choose an adjacent target and how much of the shield's enhancement bonus to allocate at the start of her turn. The target's AC bonus lasts until the wearer's next turn or until the wearer and the target are ever more than 5 feet apart, at which point the target's bonus ends and the shield's enhancement bonus works normally for the wearer. This ability only affects a shield's enhancement bonus to Armor Class, not its enhancement bonus on attack rolls (if any) or any other shield abilities.

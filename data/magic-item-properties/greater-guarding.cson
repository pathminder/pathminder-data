text: '''
  As the [*guarding*](/magic-item-properties/) property, except as a free action, the wearer selects any number of adjacent allies to receive the shield's bonus. All selected allies receive the same bonus. If a shielded target is ever more than 5 feet from the wearer, the effect ends for that target but not for any other targets.

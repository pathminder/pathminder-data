text: '''
  The discipline of Scarlet Throne arose in the battling aristocracies of the world, where its nobles initially only practiced dueling styles that were of little use. When war came, these nobles found their abilities were sorely under-prepared for the rigors of true combat. Combining their roots in the dueling arts dueling and subsequent training by masters of practical combat and leadership, the Scarlet Throne style was born. Regal and unflinching, a practitioner of Scarlet Throne owns any field of battle he walks upon, for it is his court and there he rules, painting his chambers red with the blood of his enemies.

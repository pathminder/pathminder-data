  Equal parts martial discipline and magical art form, the discipline of Elemental Flux is a martial art that is said to have roots in the bloodlines of genies and their mortal descendants. By tapping their magical natures, they were able to pioneer a style of fighting that channeled their innate magic into a cohesive fighting style. Those descended from these original genie battle masters passed their talents down through the generations, and the discipline proliferated from there. In the current day, practitioners of Elemental Flux blend arcane elemental energies with martial strikes to create a dizzying of quasi-arcane, magic-infused attacks that spell devastation and ruin to enemies
  
  Many Elemental Flux maneuvers deal damage of the initiator's active element's associated energy type. The four available active elements (and their associated energy type) are air (electricity), earth (acid), fire (fire), and water (cold). A character that knows at least one Elemental Flux maneuver chooses his active element when he readies his maneuvers, and can change it by focusing as a standard action. A character can only have one active element at a time. An Elemental Flux maneuver that deals energy damage gains that damage type as a descriptor.
  
  If a character is psionic, they can change their active energy type whenever they change their active element, and vice versa. A psionic character's active energy type need not match their active element.

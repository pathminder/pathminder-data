  The exact origins of the discipline of the Eternal Guardian difficult to determine due to the style's incredible age. One legend claims it was created by the god who first separated the planes, dividing the mortal from the immortal, while another story insists that it was founded by a single warrior who swore to defend his city from an entire invading army. These stories reflect the core of the discipline: A total devotion to a promise---usually either an oath to an ally that they will survive, no matter the cost to the disciple, or a curse on a foe that they will never escape. Today, the discipline of the Eternal Guardian has spread far and wide: It is used by bodyguards in the palaces of kings, sentinels of occult orders, and humble night watchmen making their rounds.

text: '''
  Practice of the Steel Serpent discipline dates back to ancient times, hailing from those whose work was only practiced in the dark of night, in hidden cabals dedicated to the art of killing. Steel Serpent disciples practice the art of the silent kill, using stealth, trickery, and poison in addition to martial combat skill and knowledge of anatomy. Masters of this discipline are marvels of deadly precision, their very touch capable of killing the strongest of men through the manipulation of their *ki* used as a deadly weapon. This *ki* manipulation causes the disciple's very energies to become a supernatural poison in and off itself. Swiftness and deadly precision are hallmarks of this discipline, and those that use it are known for making use of more exotic weapons. Knowledge of anatomy (of both targets and the self) is also incredibly important, as well as the knowledge of *ki* manipulation and how to effect the energies of the body.
  
  Many maneuvers and stances from this discipline are supernatural abilities.
  
  Unless expressly noted, Steel Serpent maneuvers can only be used with throwing weapons, piercing weapons, slashing weapons, and unarmed strikes.

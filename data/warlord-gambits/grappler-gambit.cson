  **Risk:** The warlord attempts a successful grapple maneuver against an opponent.
  
  **Reward:** When the warlord has his enemy pinned and he chooses to inflict damage upon him, the warlord adds a morale bonus to damage equal to his Charisma modifier until the foe successfully escapes the grapple.

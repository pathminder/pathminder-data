  **Risk:** The warlord attempts a drag combat maneuver against an opponent.
  
  **Reward:** The warlord boldly grabs his target and drags them around while inspiring his allies to action; for every 5 feet the warlord drags the opponent, his allies (other than himself himself) may move 5 feet without provoking attacks of opportunity as a free action, even if it isn't their turns.

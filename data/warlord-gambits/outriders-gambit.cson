  **Risk:** The warlord attempts a successful ranged attack while on a moving mount. The mount must move 10 feet or more to use this gambit.
  
  **Reward:** The warlord success allows his allies to reap the benefits of his skill; allies who make ranged attacks against this target opponent add the warlord's Charisma modifier as a morale bonus to their next attack roll.

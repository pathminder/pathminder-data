  **Risk:** The warlord attempts a successful called shot maneuver on a target opponent.
  
  **Reward:** The warlord's incredible accuracy livens up his allies and restores to them a measure of spirit; the warlord and his allies gain temporary hit points equal to the warlord's Charisma modifier (persisting until the end of the encounter or until they are used), helping them ignore the pains of their injuries and continue the fight.

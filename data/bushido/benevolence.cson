  The bushi's kindness and concern for his allies takes on a supernatural quality. The bushi can spend a swift action to grant all allies within 30 feet a number of temporary hit points equal to the bushi's initiator level. These temporary hit points do not stack with other temporary hit points, and last for one minute or until depleted.

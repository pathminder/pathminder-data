  Changelings are the offspring of hags and their lovers taken through magic or madness. Dropped off on doorsteps of prospective foster parents, changelings are raised by strangers. Typically tall, slender, dark haired, and attractive, changelings otherwise resemble their fathers' race. They are always female, and their mismatched colored eyes and abnormally pale skin hint at their true heritage. At puberty, changelings receive "the call," a hypnotic spiritual voice that beckons them to travel and discover their true origins. Changelings who ignore this call choose their own destiny; those who heed it discover their "mother" and may come into great power by transforming into hags themselves.

  ## Alternate Racial Traits
  
  The following racial traits may be selected instead of existing changeling racial traits. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.
  
  **Mist Child:** When the changeling has concealment or total concealment, the miss chance of attacks against her increases by 5%. This racial trait replaces hulking changeling.
  
  **Object of Desire:** The changeling adds +1 to her caster level when casting charm person and charm monster. This replaces green widow.
  
  **Ocean's Daughter:** The changeling gains a +1 trait bonus on [Swim](/skills/swim/) checks. She automatically succeeds at [Swim](/skills/swim/) checks made to avoid nonlethal damage from swimming. This racial trait replaces sea lungs.
  
  ## Favored Class Options
  
  The following options are available to all changelings who have the listed favored class, and unless otherwise stated, the bonus applies each time you select the favored class reward.
  
  **Oracle:** Add +1/2 to the oracle's level for the purpose of determining the effects of the oracle's curse ability.
  
  **Rogue:** The rogue gains 1/6 of a new rogue talent.
  
  **Witch:** Add one spell from the witch spell list to the witch's familiar. This spell must be at least one level below the highest spell level she can cast. If the witch ever replaces her familiar, the new familiar knows these bonus spells.

summary: "The small wayangs are creatures of the Plane of Shadow. They are so attuned to shadow that it even shapes their philosophy, believing that upon death they merely merge back into darkness. The mysteries of their shadowy existence grant them the ability to gain healing from negative energy as well as positive energy."

  The wayangs are a race of small supernatural humanoids who trace their ancestry to the Plane of Shadows. They are extremely gaunt, with pixielike stature and skin the color of deep shadow. Deeply spiritual, they follow a philosophy known as "The Dissolution," which teaches that in passing they may again merge into the shadow. They readily express their beliefs through ritual scarification and skin bleaching, marking their bodies with raised white dots in ornate spirals and geometric patterns. Shy and elusive, they live in small, interdependent tribes. Wayangs rarely associate with outsiders.
  
  ## Wayang Racial Traits
  
  - +2 Dexterity, +2 Intelligence, --2 Wisdom: Wayang are nimble and cagey, but their perception of the world is clouded by shadows.
  **Wayang:** Wayangs are humanoids with the wayang subtype.
  **Small:** Wayangs are Small creatures and gain a +1 size bonus to their AC, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, a --1 penalty on their CMB and to CMD, and a +4 size bonus on [Stealth](/skills/stealth/) checks.
  **Slow Speed:** Wayangs have a base speed of 20 feet.
  **Darkvision:** Wayangs can see in the dark up to 60 feet.
  **Light and Dark (Su):** Once per day as an immediate action, a wayang can treat positive and negative energy effects as if she were an undead creature, taking damage from positive energy and healing damage from negative energy. This ability lasts for 1 minute once activated.
  **Lurker:** Wayangs gain a +2 racial bonus on [Perception](/skills/perception/) and [Stealth](/skills/stealth/) checks.
  **Shadow Magic:** Wayangs add +1 to the DC of any saving throws against spells of the shadow subschool that they cast. Wayangs with a Charisma score of 11 or higher also gain the following spell-like abilities: 1/day---[*ghost sound*](/spells/ghost-sound/), [*pass without trace*](/spells/pass-without-trace/), and [*ventriloquism*](/spells/ventriloquism/). The caster level for these effects is equal to the wayang's level. The DC for these spells is equal to 10 + the spell's level + the wayang's Charisma modifier.
  **Shadow Resistance:** Wayangs get a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against spells of the shadow subschool.
  **Languages:** Wayangs begin play speaking Common and Wayang. Wayangs with high Intelligence scores can choose from the following: any human language, Abyssal, Aklo, Draconic, Goblin, Infernal, Nagaji, Samsaran, and Tengu.
  
  ## Alternate Racial Traits
  
  The following racial trait may be selected instead of existing wayang racial traits. Consult your GM before selecting this new option.
  
  **Dissolution's Child:** Once per day, you may change your appearance to look as if you were little more than a 4-foot-tall area of shadow. Your physical form still exists and you are not incorporeal---only your appearance changes. This works like [*invisibility*](spells/invisibility/), except it only lasts 1 round per level (maximum 5 rounds). This is a supernatural ability. This racial trait replaces shadow magic.
  
  ## Favored Class Options
  
  The following options are available to all wayangs who have the listed favored class, and unless otherwise stated, the bonus applies each time you select the favored class reward.
  
  **Bard:** Add one spell known from the wizard's illusion school spell list. This spell must be at least one level below the highest spell level the bard can cast. The spell is treated as being one level higher, unless it is also on the bard spell list.
  
  **Oracle:** Add one spell known from the wizard's illusion school spell list. This spell must be at least one level below the highest spell level the oracle can cast. That spell is treated as one level higher unless it is also on the oracle spell list.
  
  **Sorcerer:** Add +1/2 point of damage to any illusion spells of the shadow subschool cast by the sorcerer.
  
  **Summoner:** Add +1 skill rank to the summoner's eidolon.

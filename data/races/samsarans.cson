  Mysterious humanoids with pale blue flesh and transparent blood like the waters of a trickling brook, samsarans are ancient creatures even in their youth. A samsaran's life is not a linear progression from birth to death, but rather a circle of birth to death to rebirth. Whenever a samsaran dies, it reincarnates anew as a young samsaran to live a new life. Her past memories remain vague and indistinct---and each new incarnation is as different a creature and personality as a child is to a parent.
  
  Samsarans appear similar to humans, with dark hair and solid white eyes with no pupils or irises. Skin tones are generally shades of light blue.
  
  ## Samsaran Racial Traits
  
  All samsarans are humanoids with the samsaran subtype. They have the following racial traits.
  
  - **+2 Intelligence, +2 Wisdom, --2 Constitution:** Samsarans are insightful and strong-minded, but their bodies tend to be frail.
  - **Medium:** Samsarans are Medium creatures and have no bonuses or penalties due to their size.
  - **Normal Speed:** Samsarans have a base speed of 30 feet.
  - **Low-Light Vision (Ex):** Samsarans can see twice as far as humans in conditions of dim light.
  - **Lifebound (Ex):** Samsarans gain a +2 racial bonus on all saving throws made to resist death effects, saving throws against negative energy effects, Fortitude saves made to remove negative levels, and Constitution checks made to stabilize if reduced to negative hit points.
  - **Samsaran Magic (Sp):** Samsarans with a Charisma score of 11 or higher gain the following spell-like abilities: 1/day---[*comprehend languages*](/spells/comprehend-languages/), [*deathwatch*](/spells/deathwatch/), and [*stabilize*](/spells/stabilize/). The caster level for these effects is equal to the samsaran's level.
  - **Shards of the Past (Ex):** A samsaran's past lives grant her bonuses on two particular skills. A samsaran chooses two skills---she gains a +2 racial bonus on both of these skills, and they are treated as class skills regardless of what class she actually takes.
  - **Languages:** Samsarans begin play speaking Common and Samsaran. Samsarans with high Intelligence scores can choose from the following: any human language, Abyssal, Aquan, Auran, Celestial, Draconic, Giant, Ignan, Infernal, Nagaji, Tengu, and Terran.
  
  ## Alternate Racial Traits
  
  The following racial trait may be selected instead of existing samsaran racial traits. Consult your GM before selecting this new options.
  
  **Mystic Past Life (Su):** You can add spells from another spellcasting class to the spell list of your current spellcasting class. You add a number of spells equal to 1 + your spellcasting class's key ability score bonus (Wisdom for clerics, and so on). The spells must be the same type (arcane or divine) as the spellcasting class you're adding them to. For example, you could add divine power to your druid class spell list, but not to your wizard class spell list because divine power is a divine spell. These spells do not have to be spells you can cast as a 1st-level character. The number of spells granted by this ability is set at 1st level. Changes to your ability score do not change the number of spells gained. This racial trait replaces shards of the past.
  
  ## Favored Class Options
  
  The following options are available to all samsarans who have the listed favored class, and unless otherwise stated, the bonus applies each time you select the favored class reward.
  
  **Monk:** Add a +1/2 bonus on the monk's saving throws to resist death attacks.
  
  **Oracle:** Add one spell known from the oracle spell list. This spell must be at least one level below the highest spell level the oracle can cast.
  
  **Rogue:** The rogue gains 1/6 of a new rogue talent.
  
  **Wizard:** Add one spell from the wizard spell list to the wizard's spellbook. This spell must be at least one level below the highest spell level the wizard can cast.

  Small and insectoid in appearance, dromites stand out in most crowds of humanoids. Their antennae, faceted eyes, carapace, and small stature make them visibly different from most. Hailing from a hivemind-like history, dromites have come to love and appreciate individuality while still continuing to live in a hive and collective environment. This individuality, together with a strong liberal view on life, means that while different, dromites rarely have a problem making friends or finding a place to live or work.
  
  **Physical Description:** Around the height of gnomes and halflings, dromites stand between 3 and 4 feet tall, but tend to be sturdier in nature. Dromites have a natural resistance towards the energy of their caste granted by the chitin that covers parts of their body. The caste of a dromite is easily recognized by the coloration of the carapace: red for Fire Caste, pale blue for Ice Caste, white for Voice Caste, and green for Glimmer Caste. The skin of the dromite not covered by chitin ranges from a pale white to a dark tan. Dromites have faceted eyes which often shine with a psionic energy, and large antennae that constantly quiver. Their small mouths are devoid of external mandibles, but when eating, small internal mandibles are used to help eat. Dromites have three fingers and a thumb, each covered in a pointed carapace, with the same for their four toes. This gives the dromites a look very different from other humanoids. Dromites are asexual, being neither female nor male, except in the case of the Hive Queen and Hive Consorts. In this situation, rituals are performed that grant gender and reproductive capabilities.
  
  **Society:** Most dromites organize themselves into hive cities - giant towers that are as much subterranean as they are exposed above ground. Here they embrace their caste as well as their individuality, striving to find their path in life. For some, this means striving to become a Hive Queen or Consort, the elected leaders of a hive, while for others it means learning a craft or toiling in a mine to make ends meet. While externally very idealistic, a society with very few laws and defining aspects also tends to become chaotic and disorganized. Most hive cities tend to walk the line between individual freedoms and communal responsibility. while there are a few zealots amongst the dromites who dream of a better time, when they were all united as one mind.
  
  **Relations:** The dromites get along splendidly with halflings and gnomes most of all, and the jovial ways of both xephs and half-elves tends to put dromites at ease. The cold, distant, ways of ophiduans and maenads make the dromites curious, wishing to prod and experiment with them, to find out the reasons for their demeanors. Most other races are viewed by their individual means, but most dromites find the dwarves to be dull, boring and when drunk---gruff and coarse.
  
  **Alignment and Religion:** Most dromites are religiously indiscriminate, finding grace and faith in a number of gods, sometimes part of the same pantheon, sometimes creating their own mixes of gods and faiths. Dromites tend toward no particular alignment, not even neutral. The best and the worst are found among them.
  
  **A Note On Names:** Dromites have no gender, and thus their names are not divided between male and female. Generally, a dromite has a personal name, a caste name, and a homestead name---typically a hive city.
  
  **Personal Names:** Niks, Rask, Sask, Neksak, Leksa, Heneks, Seleks, Seksa, Aksa, Olak, Leik, Svek, Hakkor.
  
  **Caste Names:** Fire, Glimmer, Ice, Shatter, Thunder, Flash, Lightning, Sunspark, Icespear, Stormstrike.
  
  ## Dromite Racial Traits
  
  - +2 Charisma, +2 Dexterity, --2 Strength: Dromites are self-willed go-getters and naturally agile, but are weaker due to their small size.
  - **Insectoid Blood:** Dromites are of the humanoid (insectoid) subtype.
  - **Small:** Dromites are Small creatures and gain a +1 size bonus to their AC, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, a --1 penalty to their Combat Maneuver Bonus and Combat Maneuver Defense, and a +4 size bonus on [Stealth](/skills/stealth/) checks.
  - **Slow Speed:** Dromites have a base speed of 20 feet.
  - **Chitin:** Dromites receive a +1 natural armor bonus and one of the following kinds of energy resistance of their choice at creation: cold 5, electricity 5, fire 5, or sonic 5. This choice is permanent and stacks with any future energy resistance gained through other effects.
  - **Naturally Psionic:** Dromites gain the Wild Talent feat as a bonus feat at 1st level. If a dromite takes levels in a psionic class, he instead gains the Psionic Talent feat.
  - **Dromite Psionics:** Dromites gain the following psi-like ability: 1/day---*energy ray*. A dromite always deals the kind of energy damage that its chitin has resistance to (for example, a dromite who has resistance to cold 5 deals cold damage with its energy ray). The manifester level for this effect is equal to 1/2 the dromite's level (minimum 1st).
  - **Scent (Ex):** This special quality allows a dromite to detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell. Dromites with the scent ability can identify familiar odors just as humans do familiar sights.
  
    Dromites can detect opponents within 30 feet by sense of smell. If the opponent is upwind, the range increases to 60 feet; if downwind, it drops to 15 feet. Strong scents, such as smoke or rotting garbage, can be detected at twice the ranges noted above. Overpowering scents, such as skunk musk or troglodyte stench, can be detected at triple normal range.
  
    When a dromite detects a scent, the exact location of the source is not revealed---only its presence somewhere within range. The dromite can take a move action to note the direction of the scent. When the dromite is within 5 feet of the source, it pinpoints the source's location.
  
    A dromite with the scent ability can follow tracks by smell, making a Wisdom (or Survival) check to find or follow a track. The typical DC for a fresh trail is 10 (no matter what kind of surface holds the scent). This DC increases or decreases depending on how strong the quarry's odor is, the number of creatures, and the age of the trail. For each hour that the trail is cold, the DC increases by 2. The ability otherwise follows the rules for the Survival skill. Dromites tracking by scent ignore the effects of surface conditions and poor visibility.
  - **Compound Eyes:** Dromites receive a +2 racial bonus on [Perception](/skills/perception/) checks.
  - **Psionic Aptitude:** When a dromite takes a level in a favored class, it can choose to gain an additional power point instead of a hit point or skill point.
  - **Languages:** Dromites begin play speaking Common. Dromites with high Intelligence scores can choose from the following: Dwarven, Gnome, Goblin, and Terran.

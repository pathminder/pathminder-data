  Vanaras are intelligent, monkeylike humanoids that live in deep, warm forests and lush jungles. A vanara's body is covered in a thin coat of soft fur, and individuals with chestnut, ivory, and even golden coats are common. Despite their fur, vanaras can grow lengthy hair on their head just as humans can, and both male and female vanaras take pains to wear elaborate hairstyles for important social functions. The hair on a vanara's head matches the color of its fur. All vanaras have long, prehensile tails and handlike feet capable of well-articulated movements. A vanara stands slightly shorter and weighs slightly less than a typical human.
  
  ## Vanara Racial Traits
  
  - **+2 Dexterity, +2 Wisdom, --2 Charisma:** Vanaras are agile and insightful, but are also rather mischievous.
  - **Vanara:** Vanaras are humanoids with the vanara subtype.
  - **Medium:** Vanaras are Medium creatures and have no bonuses or penalties due to their size.
  - **Normal Speed:** Vanaras have a base speed of 30 feet and a climb speed of 20 feet.
  - **Low-Light Vision:** A vanara can see twice as far as a human in dim light.
  - **Nimble:** Vanaras have a +2 racial bonus on [Acrobatics](/skills/acrobatics/) and [Stealth](/skills/stealth/) checks.
  - **Prehensile Tail:** A vanara has a long, flexible tail that she can use to carry objects. She cannot wield weapons with her tail, but the tail allows her to retrieve a small, stowed object carried on her person as a swift action.
  - **Languages:** Vanaras begin play speaking Common and Vanaran. Vanaras with high Intelligence scores can choose from the following: Aklo, Celestial, Elven, Gnome, Goblin, and Sylvan.
  
  ## Alternate Racial Traits
  
  The following racial traits may be selected instead of existing vanara racial traits. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.
  
  **Tree Stranger:** Some vanaras have spent their lives among humans in centers of learning instead of traditional treetop homes. These vanaras treat all [Knowledge](/skills/knowledge/) skills as class skills, but lose their climb speed racial trait.
  
  **Whitecape:** The rare whitecape vanara clans have more in common with savanna-dwelling baboons than the jungle-dwelling monkeys that most vanaras resemble. Their stooping build grants them a +4 racial bonus to CMD when resisting a bull rush or trip. These vanaras usually have a thick mane of hair on the head and shoulders (called a "cape") and shorter tails. This racial trait replaces prehensile tail.
  
  ## Favored Class Options
  
  The following options are available to all vanaras who have the listed favored class, and unless otherwise stated, the bonus applies each time you select the favored class reward.
  
  **Alchemist:** Add +1/2 to the alchemist's bomb damage.
  
  **Druid:** Add a +1/2 bonus on wild empathy checks and a +1/2 bonus on [Handle Animal](/skills/handle-animal/) skill checks.
  
  **Fighter:** Add +1 to the fighter's CMD when resisting a reposition or trip attempt.
  
  **Monk:** Add a +1 bonus on [Acrobatics](/skills/acrobatics/) checks made to jump.
  
  **Ranger:** Add +1/4 dodge bonus to Armor Class against the ranger's favored enemies.
  
  **Rogue:** The rogue gains 1/6 of a new rogue talent.

  Human neighbors tell horrific tales of slaughter woven with frightened suspicion when speaking of strix. Strix, however, tell a tale of encroachment and a struggle for land and resources. For ages, humans invaded strix lands fighting bloody battles against the fierce, black-skinned creatures they thought to be winged devils. Over time, strix have developed a hatred for humankind and now fiercely protect their dwindling numbers.

  **Dayguard:** Familiar with watching over its tribe during the day, the strix gains a +2 racial bonus on [Perception](/skills/perception/) checks and treats [Perception](/skills/perception/) as a class skill. This racial trait replaces nocturnal.
  
  **Frightening:** The strix looks particularly menacing and use this to its advantage, gaining a +2 racial bonus on [Intimidate](/skills/intimidate/) checks. This racial trait replaces nocturnal.

Their fly speed is 20 feet (poor) instead of the normal fly speed, and they must make a DC 30 [Fly](/skills/fly/) check to fly upward.

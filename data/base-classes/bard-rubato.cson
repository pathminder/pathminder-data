      A rubato begins his career with knowledge of three martial maneuvers. The disciplines available to him are Elemental Flux, Golden Lion, and Mithral Current.

      Once the rubato knows a maneuver, he must ready it before he can use it (see Maneuvers Readied, below). A maneuver usable by rubati is considered an extraordinary ability unless otherwise noted in it or its discipline's description. A rubato's maneuvers are not affected by spell resistance, and he does not provoke attacks of opportunity when he initiates one.

      The rubato learns additional maneuvers at higher levels, as indicated on Table: The Bard. The maximum level of maneuvers gained through rubato levels is limited by those listed in that table as well, although this restriction does not apply to maneuvers added to his maneuvers known through other methods, such as prestige classes or the Advanced Study feat. A rubato must meet a maneuver's prerequisite to learn it. See the Systems and Use chapter in Path of War for more details on how maneuvers are used.

      Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even numbered initiator level thereafter (6th, 8th, 10th, and so on), the rubato can choose to learn a new maneuver in place of one he already knows. In effect, he loses the old maneuver in exchange for the new one. He can choose a new maneuver of any level he likes, as long as he observes the restriction on the highest-level maneuvers he knows; the rubato need not replace the old maneuver with a maneuver of the same level. He can swap only a single maneuver at any given level. A rubato's initiation modifier is Charisma, and each rubato level is counted as a full initiator level.

      *Maneuvers Readied:* A rubato can ready all three of his maneuvers known at 1st level, and as he advances in level and learns more maneuvers, he is able to ready more, but must still choose which maneuvers to ready. A rubato must always ready his maximum number of maneuvers readied. He readies his maneuvers by practicing weapon drills or communing with the primal rhythm for ten minutes. The maneuvers he chooses remain readied until he decides to practice again and change them. The rubato does not need to sleep or rest for any long period of time in order to ready his maneuvers; any time he spends ten minutes practicing, he can change his readied maneuvers.

      A rubato begins an encounter with all his readied maneuvers unexpended, regardless of how many times he might have already used them since he chose them. When he initiates a maneuver, he expends it for the current encounter, so each of his readied maneuvers can be used once per encounter (unless he recovers them, as described below).

      In order for the rubato to recover maneuvers, he must expend tempo. A rubato can recover a single expended maneuver as a swift action by spending 2 points of tempo, or as a free action by spending 3 points of tempo. A rubato may not recover a maneuver by spending tempo in the same round that he initiated it, though he might be able to recover it in another way.

      *Stances Known:* A rubato begins his career with knowledge of one stance from any discipline open to rubati. At 4th, 7th, 11th, and 13th levels, he can select an additional stance to learn. The maximum level of stances gained through rubato levels is limited by those listed in Table: The Bard. Unlike maneuvers, stances are not expended and the rubato does not have to ready them. All the stances he knows are available to his at all times, and he can change the stance he is currently maintaining as a swift action. A stance is an extraordinary ability unless otherwise stated in the stance or discipline description.

      Unlike with maneuvers, a rubato cannot learn a new stance at higher levels in place of one he already knows.

    text: '''
      A bard is trained to use the Perform skill to create magical effects on those around him, including himself if desired. He can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his Charisma modifier. At each level after 1st a bard can use bardic performance for 2 additional rounds per day. Each round, the bard can produce any one of the types of bardic performance that he has mastered, as indicated by his level.

      Starting a bardic performance is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. Changing a bardic performance from one effect to another requires the bard to stop the previous performance and start a new one as a standard action. A bardic performance cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the bard is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action to maintain it each round. A bard cannot have more than one bardic performance in effect at one time.

      At 7th level, a bard can start a bardic performance as a move action instead of a standard action. At 13th level, a bard can start a bardic performance as a swift action.

      Once per round as a free action, a rubato can expend one round of his bardic performance to add 2 points of tempo to his tempo pool. Alternatively, he can spend 2 points of tempo to regain one round of his bardic performance. He may only use one of these abilities in a given round. In addition, a rubato can start a bardic performance in the same action as initiating a strike by spending one additional round of his bardic performance ability.

      Each bardic performance has audible components, visual components, or both.

      If a bardic performance has audible components, the targets must be able to hear the bard for the performance to have any effect, and many such performances are language dependent (as noted in the description). A deaf bard has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a bardic performance with an audible component. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to bardic performances with audible components.

      If a bardic performance has a visual component, the targets must have line of sight to the bard for the performance to have any effect. A blind bard has a 50% chance to fail when attempting to use a bardic performance with a visual component. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Blind creatures are immune to bardic performances with visual components.

  Untold wonders and secrets exist for those skillful enough to discover them. Through cleverness, talent, and magic, these cunning few unravel the wiles of the world, becoming adept in the arts of persuasion, manipulation, and inspiration. Typically masters of one or many forms of artistry, bards possess an uncanny ability to know more than they should and use what they learn to keep themselves and their allies ever one step ahead of danger. Bards are quick-witted and captivating, and their skills might lead them down many paths, be they gamblers or jacks-of-all-trades, scholars or performers, leaders or scoundrels, or even all of the above. For bards, every day brings its own opportunities, adventures, and challenges, and only by bucking the odds, knowing the most, and being the best might they claim the treasures of each.

  A rubato (plural rubati) is a bard who taps into the Primal Song and channels it in both life and war. Theories abound about the Primal Song, though most accept that it is an echo, a shard, of something even more ancient and fundamental, but its power fuels these war singers and propels them to acts of incredible valor.

  **Role:** Bards capably confuse and confound their foes while inspiring their allies to ever-greater daring. While accomplished with both weapons and magic, the true strength of bards lies outside melee, where they can support their companions and undermine their foes without fear of interruptions to their performances.

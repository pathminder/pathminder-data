      A psychic warrior's ability to manifest powers is limited by the power points he has available. His base daily allotment of power points is given on Table 2-4: The Psychic Warrior. In addition, he receives bonus power points per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Power Points). His race may also provide bonus power points per day, as may certain feats and items.

      *Powers Known:* A psychic warrior begins play knowing one psychic warrior power of your choice. Each time he achieves a new level, he unlocks the knowledge of a new power.

      Choose the powers known from the psychic warrior power list. (Exception: The feat Expanded Knowledge does allow a psychic warrior to learn powers from the lists of other classes.) A psychic warrior can manifest any power that has a power point cost equal to or lower than his manifester level.

      The total number of powers a psychic warrior can manifest in a day is limited only by his daily power points.

      A psychic warrior simply knows his powers; they are ingrained in his mind. He does not need to prepare them (in the way that some spellcasters prepare their spells), though he must get a good night's sleep each day to regain all his spent power points.

      The Difficulty Class for saving throws against psychic warrior powers is 10 + the power's level + the psychic warrior's Wisdom modifier.

      *Maximum Power Level Known:* A psychic warrior begins play with the ability to learn 1st-level powers. As he attains higher levels, he may gain the ability to master more complex powers.

      To learn or manifest a power, a psychic warrior must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the power's level.

      At 1st level, a psychic warrior gets a bonus combat-oriented feat in addition to the feat that any 1st level character gets and the bonus feat granted to a human character. The psychic warrior gains an additional bonus feat at 2nd level and every three levels thereafter (5th, 8th, etc.). These bonus feats must be drawn from the feats noted as combat feats or psionic feats. The psychic warrior must still meet all prerequisites for the bonus feat, including ability score and base attack bonus minimums as well as class requirements (like levels in another specific class).

      These bonus feats are in addition to the feats that a character of any class gains every two levels. A psychic warrior is not limited to combat feats and psionic feats when choosing these other feats.

  Where the psion spends his days studying the intricacies of psionic power and unlocking the mysteries of the mind, others choose to use their internal power to augment their physical form. These psychic warriors use their psionic potential as a way to improve their natural abilities, becoming fierce and deadly in their chosen path.

  **Role:** The psychic warrior's path determines his strengths and weaknesses within a party. Whether he is the epitome of unleashing the beast within, or a stealthy combatant who strikes from the shadows, the psychic warrior's primary focus is typically battlefield control and dealing or blocking damage.

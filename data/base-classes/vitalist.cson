      A vitalist's ability to manifest powers is limited by the power points he has available. His base daily allotment of power points is given on Table 1: The Vitalist. In addition, he receives bonus power points per day if he has a high Wisdom score. His race may also provide bonus power points per day, as may certain feats and items.

      *Powers Known:* A vitalist begins play knowing two vitalist powers of your choice. At every odd-numbered class level after 1st, he unlocks the ability to know more powers at any given time.

      Choose the powers known from the vitalist power list. (Exception: The feat Expanded Knowledge does allow a vitalist to learn powers from the lists of other classes.) A vitalist can manifest any power that has a power point cost equal to or lower than his manifester level.

      The total number of powers a vitalist can manifest in a day is limited only by his daily power points.

      A vitalist never needs to prepare powers ahead of time; he draws them from his mind when needed. When a vitalist recovers his daily power points after resting, he may choose to rotate one or more powers he knows for new ones. These powers must always be chosen from the vitalist power list, and the maximum number of powers the vitalist may know at any one time in this fashion is listed on Table: The Vitalist. If a vitalist learns a power through other means, such as the Expanded Knowledge feat or *psychic chirurgery*, this power is known in addition to his normal powers. He may never exchange it for another power from the vitalist list when he chooses his powers known, and it doesn't count against his limit of powers known at any one time.

      The Difficulty Class for saving throws against vitalist powers is 10 + the power's level + the vitalist's Wisdom modifier.

      *Maximum Power Level Known:* A vitalist begins play with the ability to learn 1st-level powers. As he attains higher levels, he may gain the ability to master more complex powers.

      To learn or manifest a power, a vitalist must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the power's level.

      All vitalists must choose a particular method that encompasses their focus in the skills they develop. As they gain in level, their method determines the abilities they gain.

      **Guardian Method:** A guardian vitalist focuses his skill on keeping his allies from suffering wounds. He develops psionic abilities that deflect, absorb, and reflect damage proactively, rather than healing wounds after they are suffered.

      *Guardian Power:* A guardian vitalist adds *biofeedback* to his list of powers known. This does not count against his number of powers known.

      *Guardian's Touch (Vitalist's Touch):* A guardian vitalist of 2nd level who utilizes transfer wounds grants the target a number of temporary hit points equal to his class level. These temporary hit points last a number of rounds equal to the vitalist's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1) and do not stack with any other temporary hit points.

      *Guardian's Pulse (Pulse):* As a free action, a guardian of 6th level may project a pulse to all members of his collective by spending one power point, either granting them DR 2/--- for one round or improving their existing DR by 2. Every three vitalist levels thereafter, this DR gained or improved increases by 1.

      *Swift Aid:* A guardian of 8th level may, as an immediate action and by expending his psionic focus, grant a member of his collective a +1 insight bonus to AC or saves (guardian's choice) that lasts until the beginning of the target's next turn. This insight bonus increases by +1 every four vitalist levels thereafter.

      *Guardian's Expertise (Vitalist's Expertise):* Upon achieving 11th level, anytime a guardian manifests *empathic feedback*, the power gains two additional augment options.

      - If you spend 6 additional power points, this power may be manifested as an immediate action.
      - If you spend 4 additional power points, the damage dealt to the attacker is subtracted from the damage you take.

      In addition, any time a guardian manifests a power on a member of his collective (including himself) with a range of You and a duration measured in rounds, the guardian may expend his psionic focus to treat that power as if affected by the Extend Power feat.

      *Master Guardian (Master Vitalist):* A guardian of 20th level can, as a full-round action and by expending his psionic focus, give one member of the collective a psionic bubble of protection. This protective bubble grants DR 6/---, PR 27, resistance 20 against any attack that deals acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage, and a +6 deflection bonus to AC. This protective bubble lasts for one minute. The guardian can use this ability once every 10 minutes.

      **Intercessor Method:** An intercessor tries to find a solution to every problem through communication. The intercessor likely finds a peaceful solution instead of preventing, healing, or dealing harm.

      *Intercessor Power:* An intercessor vitalist adds *telempathic projection* to his list of powers known. This does not count against his number of powers known.

      *Intercessor's Touch (Vitalist's Touch):* An intercessor vitalist of 2nd level who utilizes transfer wounds shares an empathic bond with the healed target. The intercessor gains an insight bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sense Motive checks equal to his class level for all checks with that target.

      This effect lasts for a number of minutes equal to the vitalist's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). The vitalist may only have one such empathic bond active at any time, should he use transfer wounds on another target while he has an active empathic bond, the first bond immediately ends and he establishes an empathic bond with the new target.

      *Intercessor's Pulse (Pulse):* As a free action, an intercessor of 6th level may project a pulse to all members of his collective by spending one power point, granting one of the effects below at the intercessor's choice. The effect lasts for one round.

      - *Inspire Courage:* The vitalist inspires courage in the members of his collective (including himself), bolstering them against fear and improving their combat abilities. To be affected, an ally must be in the vitalist's collective. An affected ally receives a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and fear effects and a +2 competence bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls. At 12th level and 18th level, this bonus increases by +1, to a maximum of +4 at 18th level. Inspire courage is a mind-affecting ability.
      - *Inspire Competence:* All members of the collective get a +2 competence bonus on skill checks with a particular skill as long as they stay in the collective. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels the vitalist has attained beyond 6th (+3 at 10th, +4 at 14th, and +5 at 18th). Unlike the bardic performance of the same name, skills such as Stealth can be used. The vitalist can't inspire competence in himself.
      - *Sanctuary:* All members of the collective are treated as if under the effects of the *sanctuary* spell for one round, with a caster level equal to the vitalist's manifester level. If a member of the collective performs an action that would break the effect, it breaks the effect only for that member of the collective.

      *Swift Aid:* If a member of his collective fails a Will saving throw, an intercessor of 8th level may, as an immediate action and by expending his psionic focus, make an additional Will saving throw for the member of his collective. The intercessor gains a +1 insight bonus to this save. This insight bonus increases by +1 every four vitalist levels thereafter.

      If the intercessor fails the saving throw, his ally suffers the consequences of the effect that forced the Will save.

      *Intercessor's Expertise (Vitalist's Expertise) :* Upon reaching 11th level, the intercessor gains a +2 bonus to the save DC of any mind-affecting power that he manifests. This bonus stacks with any other bonus to the save DCs from his powers, including those from augmentation or feats such as Psionic Endowment.

      In addition, the intercessor can now read and speak any language.

      *Master Intercessor (Master Vitalist):* The intercessor of 20th level has learned to emit a telepathic aura that causes enemies to prefer to attack one member of the collective over the others should a peaceful solution not be possible. The intercessor chooses one member of the collective as the preferred target as a swift action with a duration of one minute. Changing the preferred target is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. At the start of the enemy's turn, it feels a mental inclination to avoid attacking all but one of the collective members. Any time an enemy makes an attack against any member of the collective other than the preferred target, they suffer a penalty to their attack and damage rolls and to rolls to breach power resistance equal to the intercessor's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1) and a penalty to the save DCs of effects that do not target the preferred target equal to half the intercessor's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1) and feel a mental inclination to instead attack the preferred target. Effects that target an area that include the preferred target are not subject to this penalty, even if other members of the collective are in the affected area.

      A member of the intercessor's collective may request to become the preferred target as a move action, at which time the intercessor may expend his psionic focus as an immediate action to allow the change in preferred targets.

      If the enemy cannot see the preferred target, the enemy does not suffer the effects of this ability. Should the preferred target be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, this effect immediately ends.

      This is a mind-affecting effect.

      **Mender Method:** A mender vitalist is the most common found, as he focuses on healing wounds more efficiently, even bringing back life to the dead. The mender vitalist learns how to boost the body's natural healing ability to unimaginable regenerative levels.

      *Mender Power:* A mender vitalist adds *natural healing* to his list of powers known. This does not count against his number of powers known.

      *Mender's Touch (Vitalist's Touch):* A mender vitalist of 2nd level who utilizes transfer wounds heals the target an additional number of hit points equal to his class level. This additional healing is not transferred to the mender like the normal amount healed.

      *Mender's Pulse (Pulse):* As a free action, a mender of 6th level may project a pulse to all members of his collective by spending one power point, granting fast healing 1 for one round. Every three vitalist levels thereafter, this fast healing increases by 1. This healing is not eligible to be redirected using Collective Healing.

      *Swift Aid:* A mender of 8th level may, as an immediate action and by expending his psionic focus, heal a member of his collective as if he had used transfer wounds.

      *Mender's Expertise (Vitalist's Expertise):* Upon achieving 11th level, a mender is skilled at restoring the psyche of the recently deceased and efficiently healing his collective members. Any time a mender manifests psionic revivify, the maximum number of rounds after the target's death allowed increases by his Wisdom modifier (minimum 1) without the need to suffer additional negative levels.

      In addition, anytime a mender manifests a power with the Healing descriptor, it heals an additional 50% hit points (round down).

      *Master Mender (Master Vitalist):* A mender of 20th level is capable of healing even the most grievous of injuries. As a full-round action and by expending his psionic focus, the mender can heal a member of his collective to full health, including restoring any ability drain, removing fatigue or exhaustion, and curing any poisons or diseases. The mender can use this ability once every 10 minutes.

      **Soulthief Method:** A soulthief vitalist develops techniques that focus on harnessing the energy of enemies, siphoning it off and using it to heal himself and his allies.

      *Soulthief Power:* A soulthief vitalist adds *collapse* to his list of powers known. This does not count against his number of powers known.

      *Soulthief's Touch (Vitalist's Touch):* A soulthief vitalist of 2nd level who utilizes transfer wounds can choose to instead deal the amount of damage that transfer wounds would normally heal plus the soulthief's class level to the target, healing himself a number of hit points equal to the damage dealt. A soulthief may not heal more hit points than the touched creature had prior to using this ability.

      This ability may only be used on creatures with a Constitution score and may not be used against creatures in the soulthief's collective. Collective members may use this ability on creatures with a total number of hit dice less than half the vitalist's level, but they gain no healing from it.

      *Soulthief's Pulse (Pulse):* As a free action, a soulthief of 6th level may project a pulse to all members of his collective by spending one power point, which empowers the attacks of the members of the collective for one round. Any successful damaging attack made with an attack roll made by a member of the collective heals the attacker for the damage dealt, up to 2 hit points of damage. Every three vitalist levels thereafter, the maximum healing granted by this aura increases by 1.

      *Swift Aid:* A soulthief of 8th level may, as an immediate action and by expending his psionic focus, transfer the wounds of a member of his collective to an enemy within 15 ft. of the ally for an amount of damage equal to the soulthief's transfer wounds ability. A successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 class level + Wisdom modifier) negates the effect.

      *Soulthief's Expertise (Vitalist's Expertise):* Upon achieving 11th level, anytime a soulthief manifests *hostile empathic transfer*, the attack can be made as a ranged touch attack with a range of 30 feet instead of as a melee touch attack. In addition, every additional power point spent augmenting hostile empathic transfer increases the additional damage transferred by 7, rather than by 5, and the maximum number of points of damage transferred increases to 85.

      In addition, any time a soulthief manifests a power or psi-like ability that deals hit point damage, it heals him for 50% of the damage dealt. If the power deals hit point damage to multiple targets, the soulthief only heals 50% of the damage to the target dealt the highest damage.

      *Master Soulthief (Master Vitalist):* A soulthief of 20th level learns how to siphon the life out of a creature. Once every 10 minutes, the soulthief can choose one target to which he has line of sight and, as a full-round action and by expending his psionic focus, begin draining the target of health (12d6 points of empathic damage) which is then transferred to the collective and heals an equal amount of damage. A successful Will save (DC 20 + Wis modifier) negates the effect. Each round, the target may attempt another Will save to negate the effect. The soulthief can maintain concentration to continue the damage each round, for up to one minute. Any damage done after all members of the collective are healed completely instead grants temporary hit points to any member of the collective (soulthief's choice) for 10 minutes. The soulthief may divide these temporary hit points as he so chooses among members of the collective.

      A vitalist learns to use psionic power to connect willing minds through an internal network that strengthens their psychic bonds. As a standard action, a vitalist can join any number of willing targets into his collective equal (up to his limit, see below) . The vitalist must have line of sight to each target, each target must have a Wisdom score of at least 1, and all targets must be within Medium range (100 ft. + 10 ft. per class level). The collective can contain up to his key ability modifier or half his vitalist level, whichever is higher. The vitalist is always considered a member of his own collective, and does not count against this limit.

      The vitalist can choose to remove a member as a free action on his turn, and any member can voluntarily leave the collective as a free action on their turn. Any member whose Wisdom drops to zero or who moves out of range of the collective (100 ft. + 10 ft. per class level) is automatically removed. If a member enters a null psionics field, the connection to the collective is suppressed until that member leaves the field. A member who leaves the collective for any reason immediately loses any and all benefits they may have gained from being a member. A vitalist is aware of the status of his collective and can, roughly, sense the presence of each member, although beyond telling if such a creature is still a member, this has no mechanical benefit until higher levels (see telepathy and health sense, below).

      A vitalist can manifest certain powers through his collective. If a vitalist power specifies one or more willing targets (or is harmless) and has a range greater than personal, he can manifest this power on a member of his collective regardless of the range of the actual power. All other non-range restrictions still apply. He may also manifest any power with the Network descriptor this way, regardless of their actual ranges or targets. If he is capable of manifesting powers or casting spells from a different class (as is the case for a multiclass vitalist), any compatible spell or power with a range greater than touch can also be used through the collective.

      If a member of the collective dies, the member is removed from the collective and the vitalist must make a Fortitude save (DC 15) or lose 1 power point for every Hit Die of the fallen member and be sickened for an equal number of rounds.

      At 15th level, a vitalist's collective range is limitless on the same plane as the vitalist.

      At 19th level, a vitalist's collective reaches even across to other planes and dimensions.

      Whenever a willing member of the vitalist's collective could regain lost hit points or ability damage, the vitalist may choose to redirect any or all of that healing to one or more other willing members of the collective as a free action. This can transfer instantaneous healing (such as a *body adjustment* power), healing from ongoing healing effects, such as fast healing, and even hit points gained from rest (in which case, a member of the collective would rest for a period of time as normal, and the amount of hit points and ability damage healed would go to another).

      In any case, the original recipient of the healing effect chooses whether to allow the diverted healing, and does not gain the benefits of any healing he grants to another. The type of healing (positive energy, negative energy, construct repair, etc.) is unchanged from the original source for determining who or what can be healed.

      *Example: Darius the soulknife is a willing member of Jorus the vitalist's collective. He drinks a potion of cure light wounds that would normally heal him for 6 hit points, but Jorus decides to redirect 4 of those points to himself. Darius agrees and, as a result, Darius is healed for 2 hit points, and Jorus is healed for 4. If there were more members in Jorus's collective, Jorus could spread the healing from that potion out even more as long as the sum of hit points healed was no greater than 6.*

      A vitalist may even heal wounds through collective healing if at full health. This may only be used with healing effects such as potions, powers, or other such effects. Healing from long term care or natural healing cannot be transferred in this way.

      Beginning at 2nd level, a vitalist may take a swift action to gauge the relative health level of collective members, determining the amount of damage, in hit points, that an ally has taken. In addition, the vitalist may make a Heal check as a standard action, with a DC of 15, to determine if any of the members of his collective are afflicted by a disease or poison.

      Starting at 7th level, the vitalist can make a Heal check over his collective to stabilize a dying target or treat a wound from a caltrop, spike growth, spike stones, or similar.

      This ability improves at 12th level, and the vitalist may make a Heal check over his collective to treat a poisoned creature.

      At 17th level, the vitalist is able to treat diseases in the same fashion, making a Heal check over his collective.

      A vitalist of 2nd level gains special abilities when manifesting powers with the Network descriptor. He can manifest these powers on any member of his collective, even if they are out of the power's range or would normally be immune to the power. Whenever a vitalist manifests a power with the Network descriptor targeting only members of his collective, the power loses the mind-affecting descriptor (if it had it) and bypasses any power resistance, although it still provokes an attack of opportunity to manifest as normal. Network powers manifest only on members of the collective never allow saving throws---their saving throw entry becomes "None," although if the power specifies a subsequent saving throw, subjects attempt those saves normally. The vitalist also adds the following augment to all powers with the Network descriptor:

      At 3rd level, a vitalist has learned to siphon the health of a creature and use it for his own needs or the needs of his collective. As a touch attack, the vitalist may deal a number of hit points in damage to the target equal to his vitalist level + his Wisdom modifier and heal an equal amount of damage. The vitalist may share any healing from this effect over his collective, even if he himself would not be eligible for the healing. A vitalist may not heal more hit points than the touched creature had prior to using this ability.

      This ability may only be used on creatures with a Constitution score and may not be used against creatures in the vitalist's collective. A vitalist may use this ability on creatures with a total number of hit dice less than half his vitalist level, but he gains no healing from it.

      *For example, Jorus is a level 3 vitalist with a Wisdom of 16 and 15 hit points. Jorus has suffered 3 hit points of damage and uses Steal Health on a nearby 2 hit dice orc, dealing 6 hit points of damage (3 from his levels in vitalist, 3 from his Wisdom modifier). Although Jorus may only heal himself for 3 hit points, he may distribute the other 3 hit points over the collective to other members as needed. If Jorus was level 6, he would have dealt 9 points of damage, but would not have received any healing because the orc's total number of hit dice was too low.*

      At 7th level, a vitalist is able to use steal health as a ranged touch attack with a range of 30 feet.

By making a successful melee touch attack and expending psionic focus, the vitalist can force the target to make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + half class level + Wisdom modifier) or die. A successful save negates this effect. Targets with more than 140 hit points are unaffected by this ability.

      If the target fails the save, the vitalist is able to channel the stolen life force through his collective, healing any number of the members of his collective for a combined total of 5 hit points per hit die the original target had.

      This ability may only be used on creatures with a Constitution score and may not be used against creatures in the vitalist's collective.

      *For example, Jorus is a level 14 vitalist and he uses steal life on a thought slayer, which has 11 hit dice. The thought slayer fails the Fortitude save, so Jorus can heal up to 55 hit points over his collective, divided among the members as he sees fit.*

      A vitalist must wait 10 minutes after using this ability before he can attempt to use it again.

      This is considered a death effect.

  Where the egoist is the master of his own body through the power of psychometabolism, vitalists blend the disciplines of telepathy, psychometabolism, and clairsentience to pool multiple creatures into a larger collective of beings, sharing the health of the many to keep each individual well. They are the masters of psionic healing, distributing regenerative energy with the precision of a surgeon. A vitalist's psionic powers and his collective are his most vital abilities.

  **Role:** Regardless of their chosen method, all vitalists can act as the party medic: healing wounds, curing ailments, and augmenting the physical form. The method in which they perform this role varies from vitalist to vitalist. As light armor wearers with minimal combat skill, vitalists are typically not found on the front line of battle. Helping his allies---whether by healing them or making your enemies weaker---is what a vitalist does best.

      A warlord begins his career with knowledge of six martial maneuvers. The disciplines available to him are Broken Blade, Golden Lion, Riven Hourglass Steel Serpent, Solar Wind, and Thrashing Dragon. The warlord may also exchange access to one of his martial disciplines for the Unquiet Grave discipline. He gains the associated skill of each of his disciplines as a class skill.

      Once he knows a maneuver, he must ready it before he can use it (see Maneuvers Readied, below). A maneuver usable by warlords is considered an extraordinary ability unless otherwise noted in its description. His maneuvers are not affected by spell resistance, and he do not provoke attacks of opportunity when he initiates one. He learns additional maneuvers at higher levels, as shown on Table 1-3: The Warlord. The warlord must meet a maneuver's prerequisite to learn it.

      Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even numbered warlord level after that, he can choose to learn a new maneuver in place of one he already knows. In effect, the warlord loses the old maneuver in exchange for the new one. He can choose a new maneuver of any level he likes, as long as he observes his restriction on the highest-level maneuvers he knows. The warlord need not replace the old maneuver with a maneuver of the same level. The warlord can swap only a single maneuver at any given level. A warlord's initiation modifier is Charisma.

      *Maneuvers Readied:* A warlord can ready four of his six starting maneuvers, but as he advances in level and learns more maneuvers, he must choose which maneuvers to ready. He readies his maneuvers by going through weapon drills for 10 minutes. The maneuvers he chooses remain readied until he decides to repeat this again and change them. Warlords do not need to sleep or rest for any long period of time to ready their maneuvers; any time he spends 10 minutes in practice, he can change his readied maneuvers. He may not ready any individual maneuver more than once. He begins an encounter with all readied maneuvers unexpended, regardless of how many times he may have already used them since he chose them. When the warlord initiates a maneuver, he expends it for the current encounter, so each of his readied maneuver can be used once per encounter (until they are recovered, see below).

      For a warlord to recover expended maneuvers, he must perform one of two types of actions: a gambit action in which he gambles on his performance in battle (see Warlord's Gambit below), or he may spend a standard action to recover a single readied maneuver of his choosing.

      *Stances Known:* Warlords begin play with knowledge of one stance from any discipline open to warlords. At the indicated levels (see class table), the warlord selects an additional new stance. Unlike maneuvers, stances are not expended and he does not have to ready them. All the stances he knows are available to him at all times, and he can change the stance he is currently using as a swift action. A stance is an extraordinary ability unless otherwise stated in the stance description. Unlike with maneuvers, the warlord cannot learn a new stance at higher levels in place of one he already knows.

      At his core, the warlord is a warrior who relies on both skill and daring; without this he is but any other combatant. By setting himself to danger, does his true skill shine, or so the motto of the warlord goes. At 1st level, a warlord selects two [gambits](/warlord-gambits/) as methods by which the warlord can recover expended maneuvers.

      Each gambit possesses three aspects---a risk, a rake, and a reward.

      Each gambit's risk describes an action that the warlord must undertake in order to attempt to recover an expended maneuver. The warlord begins a gambit as a swift action, effectively diving recklessly into the act he is attempting. The warlord then performs the action described in the gambit, and if he is successful, he regains maneuvers (see below). If he is not, he suffers the rake of the gambit and only regains a single maneuver of his choosing. While performing a gambit, the warlord may add his Charisma modifier to the d20 check(s) to aid in accomplishing the gambit as a luck bonus. A warlord may attempt the actions of a gambit, but without declaring the attempt a gambit attempt by spending a swift action to do so, the character does not regain any maneuvers nor does he suffer a rake for failure. The character may initiate a maneuver while performing a gambit (if the maneuver helps him accomplish it) but he may not recover the maneuver used to achieve the gambit as part of the reward.

      A gambit's rake is the penalty that the warlord suffers if he attempts his gambit and fails, such as failing a trip attempt or failing to strike an opponent with a charge attack. All gambits possess the same rake: the warlord only regains a single expended maneuver and suffers a --2 penalty on all d20 rolls for one round.

      A warlord who succeeds at fulfilling his gambit immediately recovers a number of expended maneuvers equal to his Charisma modifier (minimum 2) and enjoys the unique reward for each gambit. Allies who would receive benefits from a warlord's successful gambit must be within 60 ft. of the warlord and must be able to see him perform the action.

      Finally, gambits may not be initiated outside of combat due to their reliance upon the stresses of battle to bring out the best of the warlord.

      The warlord excels in the theater of war because he knows how best to work with his allies. At 3rd level, the warlord becomes an ever more capable commander and may share tactics with his allies. First, the warlord gains a teamwork feat as a bonus feat (he must meet the prerequisites for this feat to select it).

      As a standard action that the warlord performs, the warlord and allies within 30 feet of him can share teamwork feats that they possess with each other, acting as if they both possessed the teamwork feat that they are sharing. The warlord can only share one teamwork feat at a time, either one of his own (with all allies within 30-ft. of him) or an ally's (in which case only the warlord receives the ability to use the teamwork feat he does not possess). The warlord and allies retain the use of this feat for 3 + the warlord's Charisma modifier in rounds. The character may use this ability 1 + Charisma modifier times per day at 3rd level (minimum of 1), and one additional time per day for every four warlord levels the character possesses.

  Dynamos on the field of combat, warlords walk the line of victory and ruin through their determination to achieve glory. Where some may talk tactics, the warlord dives in. Where some may fight in strategic units, the warlord shines alone as an inspirational beacon on the field of combat; to be a warlord is to be a lord of war.

  Many warlords make their way on the battlefield with mighty massive blades or paired axes, but some find that their own bodies are weapon enough, and find themselves useful for missions of stealth and espionage. Through extensive training, these steelfist commandos are known to be leaders of tactical operative groups and capable of using their natural talents instead of relying on heavy or expensive weapons and armor. They are able to often slip in undetected past their foes.

  **Adventures:** Warlords adventure for many reasons, but one reason that will always be prominent is the desire to test their skill against the world's most dangerous opponents, to show their strength to themselves and to the world. Others may do this for profit, others for fun, others for revenge, but it is always certain that a warlord seeks the glory and honor only a battle well-fought can bring.

  **Characteristics:** Brash arrogance and an irrepressible nature are hallmarks of the warlord. A devil-may-care warrior, many warlords are as fearless as they are fierce, and they both love life and live their lives to the fullest. Hedonists in some extreme cases, the warlord is drawn to combat as a moth to the flame.

  **Alignment:** Any. Warlords can come from any and all ethical backgrounds, though they do tend more towards a chaotic alignment. Lawfully aligned warlords are rarer, and tend to compose their impulses through strict discipline.

  **Religion:** While not overly religious, some warlords follow gods of war and battle with temperaments similar to their own.

  **Background:** Warlords come from families with strong warrior traditions, from barbaric tribes and from academies that produce the strongest warriors. One thing that sets them apart is their reckless nature and the inspirational presence they possess.

  **Races:** Humans and half-elves are prominent warlord races due to both possessing an impetuous nature. Half-orcs become very fearsome warlords in their own right, and dwarves are known for their ferocity when defending their homes.

  **Other Classes:** Warlords get on well with fighters, rangers, and barbarians as their martial nature makes them amicable, but paladins and warders tend to chafe under their recklessness. Wizards and especially bards and sorcerers get on quite well with them, and clerics find them to be tolerable.

  **Role:** Striker. As a very aggressive class, the warlord seeks to bring martial power to the field in the form of overwhelming force and ferocity. Additionally, warlords make excellent leaders, as they provide some passive benefits from their class features as well as active benefits from discipline choices and their gambits.

  **Abilities:** Strength and Charisma are incredibly important to a warlord, as without Strength the warlord is weaker in combat and without Charisma many of his abilities will not function, as Charisma is the warlord's primary initiation attribute. Constitution is important for vital hit points. Intelligence and Dexterity take up the bottom of importance, for both skill points and defense (or ranged combat).

      A stalker begins his career with knowledge of six martial maneuvers. The disciplines available to him are Broken Blade, Solar Wind, Steel Serpent, Thrashing Dragon, and Veiled Moon, and the choice of either Riven Hourglass or Tempest Gale. The stalker may also exchange access to one of his martial disciplines for the Unquiet Grave discipline. He gains the associated skill of each of his disciplines as a class skill.

      Once he knows a maneuver, he must ready it before he can use it (see Maneuvers Readied, below). A maneuver usable by stalkers is considered an extraordinary ability unless otherwise noted in its description. His maneuvers are not affected by spell resistance, and he does not provoke attacks of opportunity when he initiates one. He learns additional maneuvers at higher levels, as shown above. The stalker must meet a maneuver's prerequisite to learn it.

      Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even numbered stalker level after that, he can choose to learn a new maneuver in place of one he already knows. In effect, the stalker loses the old maneuver in exchange for the new one. The stalker need not replace the old maneuver with a maneuver of the same level. He can choose a new maneuver of any level he likes, as long as he observes his restriction on the highest-level maneuvers he knows. The stalker can swap only a single maneuver at any given level. A stalker's initiator modifier is Wisdom.

      *Maneuvers Readied:* A stalker can ready four of his six starting maneuvers, but as he advances in level and learns more maneuvers, he must choose which maneuvers to ready. He readies his maneuvers by meditating and focusing his *ki* for 10 minutes. The maneuvers he chooses remain readied until he decides to repeat this again and change them. Stalkers do not need to sleep or be well rested to ready their maneuvers; any time he spends 10 minutes in meditation, he can change his readied maneuvers. He may not ready any individual maneuver more than once. He begins an encounter with all readied maneuvers unexpended, regardless of how many times he may have already used them since he chose them. When the stalker initiates a maneuver, he expends it for the current encounter, so each of his readied maneuvers can be used once per encounter (until they are recovered, see below).

      Stalkers may recover their maneuvers in one of two ways. The stalker may either center his awareness of the combat momentarily as a standard action and recover a single expended maneuver of his choice.

      Alternately, he may recover his Wisdom modifier in expended maneuvers (minimum 2) as a full round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, centering his spirit completely to re-align his perceptions of the battle and change his place in it. When recovering his maneuvers as a full round action, he may move up to his base speed and adds a +4 insight bonus to his Armor Class as his *ki* defends his form while he re-centers himself. The next attack or martial strike he attempts after recovering his maneuvers adds his deadly strike's damage to the attack if successful.

      *Stances Known:* Stalkers begin play with knowledge of one stance from any discipline open to stalkers. At the indicated levels (see class table), the stalker selects an additional new stance. Unlike maneuvers, stances are not expended and he does not have to ready them. All the stances he knows are available to him at all times, and he can change the stance he is currently using as a swift action. A stance is an extraordinary ability unless otherwise stated in the stance description. Unlike with maneuvers, the stalker cannot learn a new stance at higher levels in place of one he already knows.

      At 1st level, a stalker gains a pool of *ki* points, supernatural energy he can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in the stalker's *ki* pool is equal to 1/2 her stalker level + his Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1).

      At 1st level, the stalker may spend 1 point of *ki* to grant himself a +4 insight bonus to a single Perception or Sense Motive check as an immediate action, as he uses his *ki* to feel out the vibrations of others and their hidden motives.

      At 5th level, the stalker may use his deadly strikes in conjunction with his combat insight to "read" his opponent's defenses and deliver devastating blows beyond his foe's guard. The stalker spends one point of *ki* as a swift action to read his target opponent, and may apply his deadly strike to all martial strikes initiated by the stalker for a number of rounds equal to his Wisdom modifier against this target. If the stalker scores a successful critical hit against the target while this ability is active, then he activates deadly strike as normal.

      At 7th level, the stalker may spend 1 point from his *ki* pool to gain a +4 insight bonus on a saving throw as an immediate action.

      At 9th level, the stalker can delve into his subconscious in battle and remember key lessons from his training. The stalker envisions potential scenarios where martial abilities he has not readied come into play and gains a momentary burst of martial insight. A number of times per day equal to his Wisdom modifier, the stalker can spend one *ki* point as a swift action and trade one readied maneuver for another maneuver known of the same level or lower. The new maneuver is immediately readied and accessible for use. The character may initiate this maneuver and recover it as if he had prepared at the beginning of the day (or when ever the stalker readied his maneuvers last) until the end of the combat encounter.

      The *ki* pool is replenished each day after 8 hours of rest and meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive. If the stalker possesses levels in another class that grants points to a *ki* pool, stalker levels stack with the levels of that class to determine the total number of *ki* points in the combined pool, but only one ability score modifier is added to the total. The choice of which score to use is made when the second class ability is gained, and once made, the choice is set. The stalker can now use *ki* points from this pool to power the abilities of every class he possesses that grants a *ki* pool.

      The stalker is capable of maximizing his deadliness whenever he lands a critical blow upon his opponent, opening his target up for future punishment as the stalker becomes attuned to his prey. The stalker's deadly strike activates whenever the stalker scores a successful critical hit against a target, and is active against that target for a number of rounds equal to his Wisdom modifier. Deadly strike inflicts extra damage, to only this target creature, on all of the stalker's attacks. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 for every four stalker levels thereafter. When the stalker scores a critical hit, this extra damage is not multiplied, it is simply added to the damage. If the stalker scores a successful critical hit during the time his deadly strike is active, the duration of this ability is extended by one round (no more than one extension can be made per round). Ranged attacks can count as deadly strikes only if the target is within 30 feet.

      Deadly strike is more effective with weapons with higher critical multipliers, such as scythes and battle axes. Weapons with a x3 critical multiplier inflict damage with deadly strikes using d8s instead of d6s, and weapons with a critical multiplier of x4 or higher use d10s.

      Deadly strike may not be used with weapons that inflict non-lethal damage. The stalker must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. Creatures immune to critical hits or precision damage cannot be targeted by a deadly strike. A stalker cannot deadly strike while attacking a creature who has concealment.

      At 2nd level, the keen senses and awareness of the stalker delivers him a sort of sixth sense. This insight performs as an intuitive alarm, alerting him of danger. Through his rigorous practice and learning to trust his instincts and intuition to an unearthly level, the senses of the stalker are unusually sharp.

      At 2nd level, the stalker's combat sense opens his third eye, granting him defensive reflexes that protect him in combat. The stalker may add his Wisdom modifier to his initiative score and to Reflex saving throws as an insight bonus.

      At 4th level, the heightened perceptions of the stalker allow him to know when his prey could get the jump on him, granting him the uncanny dodge class feature, as per the rogue class.

      At 8th level, the killer's instinct in the stalker is honed to a razor's fine edge, allowing him to add his Wisdom modifier as a competence bonus to confirm critical hits. This ability counts as if the character possessed the Critical Focus feat, and for the purposes of taking critical feats that the character qualifies for. The character may not select the Critical Focus feat once he has this ability, and should he have it before he gains this ability, he loses the Critical Focus feat and may select a critical feat in its place.

      At 12th level, the stalker's insight allows him to funnel the *ki* of his foes into his form with his deadly attacks. The character can recover a single expended maneuver when he scores a successful critical hit against a living creature. This ability does not function against constructs, undead, or creatures with under 1⁄2 HD.

      At 18th level, the heightened precognitive abilities of the stalker manifest in his ability to sense things around him that others cannot, granting him blindsight with a range of 30 feet. This is a supernatural ability.

When the stalker is harmed by an attack, spell, or ability of an enemy, as an immediate action he may spend two *ki* points to initiate a martial strike that he has readied (with an initiation action of one standard action) in retaliation against that attack. He uses the range of the attacker's ability as the range of his strike, creating a phantom echo of himself with his *ki* (as with the phantom reach art) that rushes out and strikes his attacker if they are outside of the stalker's normal reach. Use of this ability expends his strike as normal, and the strike functions as normal otherwise."

  An effective warrior wielding both skill and stealth, the stalker is a martial disciple who battles in the deep shadows and the hidden underworld of night. Through rigorous training and deep, intuitive instincts, the stalker is a trained killer whose very art is considered illegal in some places. Part mystic, part warrior, and part assassin, the stalker's arts are varied, but always deadly.

  **Adventures:** Stalkers adventure for many reasons, but most do so either as part of a guild of fellow stalkers on a mission, for money and profit, or for deeper, often darker purposes of the heart. Some adventure for the test of their skill, but this is slightly rarer; whatever the reason, the path of the stalker is often a self-absorbed one.

  **Characteristics:** Stalkers universally are very introspective people, they rely so heavily upon their intuitive reactions to situations and their heightened reflexes through athletic skill that they usually have an air of detachment. Some are braggarts, but many are quiet and calm, paying close attention to their surroundings should they need to use their lethal skills.

  **Alignment:** Any. Stalkers do not lean to any particular alignment trend, running the gamut of all walks of life.

  **Religion:** Some stalkers are deeply religious, finding solace in their meditations to gods of night, death, travels, or revelry. Other stalkers find no use for gods, for if the gods protected and cared for their flock, then they wouldn't make their followers so easy to kill.

  **Background:** Stalkers often arise from the poor and underprivileged who live in city slums, trained from their youth to be unfeeling killers. Others are trained in remote areas in a more monastic fashion, taught to be warriors who strike from the shadows. The training of stalkers can also be an individual thing, each master teaching a student in their own way, the way they were taught.

  **Races:** Humans and outcast races tend to be drawn to the path of the stalker. Half-orcs and half-elves make up a majority of the non-human stalkers, with goblinoids coming in next.

  **Other Classes:** Stalkers get on well with rogues and rangers due to having complementary roles. Paladins and clerics often chafe when partied with stalkers, as their reputation as killers (rightly or wrongly) often sours opinions of them. Other classes generally have a neutral opinion of stalkers, unless that stalker has come for them.

  **Role:** Striker. In the party, the stalker follows the heavily armored fighter into combat, using them as shields and distractions so they can inflict maximum damage on their foes. In addition, the stalker can serve quite well as the party scout, finding danger and warning the party before they stumble upon it.

  **Abilities:** Dexterity and Wisdom are prime attributes for stalkers, as many of their skills are governed by these abilities and their combat capabilities are augmented by them as well. Wisdom is the primary initiating attribute for stalker. Strength is valuable for damage, but can fall behind Constitution for endurance in battle.

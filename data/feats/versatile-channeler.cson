prerequisites: [
  "channel energy class feature"
  "necromancer or neutrally aligned cleric (see below)"
]
benefit: '''
  You may make a choice whenever you use your channel energy class feature.
  
  If you normally channel positive energy, you may choose to channel negative energy as if your effective cleric level were 2 levels lower than normal.
  
  If you normally channel negative energy, you may choose to channel positive energy as if your effective cleric level were 2 levels lower than normal.
  
  Having this feat means you qualify for feats and abilities that have "channel positive energy" or "channel negative energy" as a prerequisite (for example, you qualify for the [Command Undead](/feats/command-undead/) feat and the [Turn Undead](/feats/turn-undead/) feat).
'''
special: '''
  This feat only applies to necromancers, neutral clerics who worship neutral deities, or neutral clerics who do not worship a deity---characters who have the channel energy class ability and have to make a choice to channel positive or negative energy at 1st level. Clerics whose alignment or deity makes this choice for them cannot select this feat.

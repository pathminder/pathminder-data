benefit: '''
  Choose one type of shield (buckler, light, heavy, or tower shield) for which you possess the [Shield Specialization](/feats/shield-specialization/) feat. With the selected shield, you gain a +2 bonus to your Armor Class against critical hit confirmation rolls (this bonus stacks with that from [Shield Specialization](/feats/shield-specialization/)). In addition, once per day you may negate a critical hit, and damage is instead rolled normally.
'''
special: '''
  You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new type of shield.

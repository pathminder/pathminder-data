benefit: '''
  Only enchantment spells that affect a single target and can be negated with a successful Will save can be trick spells. If the target fails its Will save against a trick spell, in addition to the spell's normal effects, the target also clumsily hinders itself. Immediately attempt a special combat maneuver check (1d20 + your caster level + your Charisma bonus) to perform a dirty trick combat maneuver against the target. Any feats you have that apply to dirty trick maneuvers (such as [Greater Dirty Trick](/feats/greater-dirty-trick/)) also apply to this check.
  
  A trick spell takes up a spell slot 1 level higher than the spell's actual level.

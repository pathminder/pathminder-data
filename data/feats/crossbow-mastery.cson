benefit: '''
  The time required for you to reload any type of crossbow is reduced to a free action, regardless of the type of crossbow used. You can fire a crossbow as many times in a full attack action as you could attack if you were using a bow. Reloading a crossbow for the type of crossbow you chose when you took [Rapid Reload](/feats/rapid-reload/) no longer provokes attacks of opportunity.
'''
special: '''
  Starting at 6th level, a ranger with the archery combat style may select [Crossbow Mastery](/feats/crossbow-mastery/) as a combat style feat.

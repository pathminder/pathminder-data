summary: "Increase threat modifier when flanking"
flavor_text: "Through working together, you and an ally are capable of striking vital locations."
prerequisites: [
  "deadly strike +1d6"
  "at least one [Steel Serpent](/martial-disciplines/steel-serpent/) stance known."
]
benefit: "Whenever you and another ally flank a creature both you and that ally increase the critical threat range of your weapons by 1 (so a weapon with a 19--20 threat range would increase to 18-20) if you or your ally are in a stance from the [Steel Serpent](/martial-disciplines/steel-serpent/) discipline. This additional critical threat range is not multiplied by abilities such as keen or the Improved Critical feat and is applied after abilities such as those are applied."

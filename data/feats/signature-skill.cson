flavor_text: "Your ability with a particular skill is the stuff of legends, and you can do things with that skill that others cannot."
prerequisites: [
  "5 ranks in the chosen skill"
]
benefit: '''
  Choose one skill. You gain the ability listed in that skill's 5 Ranks entry. As you gain more ranks in the chosen skill, you gain additional abilities. If you have 10 or more ranks in the chosen skill, you gain the appropriate abilities immediately. If your chosen skill is Craft, Knowledge, Perform, or Profession, you gain the listed powers only for one category of that skill, such as Craft (bows). This feat can be taken only once, but it stacks with the rogue's edge ability and the cutting edge rogue talent.

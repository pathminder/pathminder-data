benefit: '''
  Whenever you move, you may move through 5 feet of earth- or stone-based difficult terrain (rubble, stone stairs, and so on) each round as if it were normal terrain. The effects of this feat stack with similar feats such as [Acrobatic Steps](/feats/acrobatic-steps/) and [Nimble Moves](/feats/nimble-moves/). This feat allows you to take a 5-foot step into this kind of difficult terrain.

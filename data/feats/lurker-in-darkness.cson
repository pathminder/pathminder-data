name: "Lurker in Darkness"
sources: [
  "Path of War: Expanded"

summary: "Use Stealth to hide from unusual senses"
flavor_text: "Your training allows you to foil even magical and unusual senses."
prerequisites: [
  "Stealth 6 ranks"
]
benefit: "Creatures using unusual forms of sensory perception such as blindsight, greensight, or tremorsense cannot automatically foil your use of Stealth; such creatures must make a Perception check as normal to detect you when you make use of the Stealth skill. This feat foils indirect detection (such as a creature using *detect magic* to search for your magical items while you are using Stealth) in the manner described above, but has no effect on psi-like abilities, powers, spells, spell-like abilities, and/or supernatural abilities specifically used to uncover information about you rather than enhancing the user's perception, such as the *augury* spell."

benefit: '''
  Whenever you make a [Knowledge](/skills/knowledge/) check to identify a creature, even when using [Kirin Style](/feats/kirin-style/), you can take 10 even if stress and distractions would normally prevent you from doing so. While using [Kirin Style](/feats/kirin-style/) against a creature you have identified using that feat, if the creature ends its turn within your threatened area, you can spend a use of your attacks of opportunity that round to move up to 5 feet times your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). You must end your move in a square threatened by the creature. This move does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

benefit: '''
  Whenever you score a critical hit with a melee attack, you can move your opponent, in addition to the normal damage dealt by the attack. If your confirmation roll exceeds your opponent's CMD, you may move your opponent as if from the reposition combat maneuver. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity.
'''
normal: '''
  You must perform a reposition combat maneuver to reposition an opponent.

  While raging, you can throw a two-handed weapon as a standard action, and you double the range increment for weapons you throw. If you also have the [Quick Draw](/feats/quick-draw/) feat, you can throw two-handed weapons at your full normal rate of attacks. Further, you can pick up an unattended object that you can use as a improvised weapon within your reach as part of the attack action to throw that item.

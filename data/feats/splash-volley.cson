flavor_text: "Your allies are used to being in the splash zone of your hurled weapons, and try to ensure that at least your opponent gets hit."
prerequisites: [
  "Base attack bonus +1"
]
benefit: '''
  You initiate this feat whenever you throw a splash weapon into a square within the reach of an ally who also has this feat and miss your target. Rather than you rolling to see where the weapon lands, the abettor can try to redirect it as an immediate action by making a melee touch attack against any adjacent foe. If the abettor's attack hits that foe, the splash weapon impacts in the nearest square the targeted foe occupies.

flavor_text: "You whirl your foe around and then let go."
prerequisites: [
  "[Combat Expertise](/feats/combat-expertise/)"
  "[Improved Bull Rush](/feats/improved-bull-rush/)"
  "[Improved Trip](/feats/improved-trip/)"
  "[Improved Unarmed Strike](/feats/improved-unarmed-strike/)"

benefit: '''
  On a successful unarmed trip combat maneuver against an opponent your size or smaller, you can spend a swift action to attempt a bull rush combat maneuver against that opponent. If your bull rush succeeds, you can move that opponent to any unoccupied square you threaten, then push that opponent the number of 5-foot increments your successful bull rush allows. The target is then knocked prone. If the bull rush fails, you can use the [*Ki* Throw](/feats/ki-throw/) feat as normal.
  
  If you also have the [Improved *Ki* Throw](/feats/improved-ki-throw/) feat, a successful bull rush allows you to push the opponent into a space secondary targets occupy. You resolve this effect as if you used the [Improved *Ki* Throw](/feats/improved-ki-throw/) feat to throw the opponent into that space.
'''
special: '''
  Per the [*Ki* Throw](/feats/ki-throw/) feat, a monk can use *ki* to affect creatures larger than himself with this feat.

  When casting *summon monster*, you also have access to the list of evil monsters below. When summoning a creature from this list, your debased nature allows you to cast the spell as a standard action. The summoned creature appears as normal for the spell but can't act until next your next turn. It is not flat-footed, however, and it can make attacks of opportunity as normal. These effects don’t apply for creatures from the standard list that aren’t also on this list.

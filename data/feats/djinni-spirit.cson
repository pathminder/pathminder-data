While using [Djinni Style](/feats/djinni-style/), you gain electricity resistance equal to your base attack bonus or monk level, whichever is higher. While denied your Dexterity bonus to AC you are also denied this resistance. Creatures that take electricity damage from your [Elemental Fist](/feats/elemental-fist/) attack must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier) or be deafened for 1d4 rounds. Those who take damage from your [Djinni Spin](/feats/djinni-spin/) are deafened, even on a successful saving throw.

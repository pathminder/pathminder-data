benefit: '''
  You and your mount can overlap the space of mounts whose riders have this feat, although no more than two creatures can share any one square. Further, you can charge through a space containing an allied mount if that mount's rider has this feat, although the space from which you make your charge attack must comply with this feat's other benefit or be unoccupied.

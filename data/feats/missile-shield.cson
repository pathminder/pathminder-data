benefit: '''
  You must be using a light, heavy, or tower shield to use this feat. Once per round when you would normally be hit with an attack from a ranged weapon (not including spell effects, natural attacks, or massive ranged weapons), you may deflect it so that you take no damage, as if you had the [Deflect Arrows](/feats/deflect-arrows/) feat. You must be aware of the attack and not flat-footed.

flavor_text: "You dazzle creatures when you affect them with a spell that has the fire, light, or electricity descriptor."
benefit: '''
  The electricity, fire, or light effects of the affected spell create a flaring that dazzles creatures that take damage from the spell. A flare spell causes a creature that takes fire or electricity damage from the affected spell to become dazzled for a number of rounds equal to the actual level of the spell. A flaring spell only affects spells with a fire, light, or electricity descriptor.
  
  A flaring spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.

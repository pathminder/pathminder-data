summary: "Use Solar Wind boosts with Mithral Current wave strikes"

prerequisites: [
  "Quick Draw"
  "two [Mithral Current](/martial-disciplines/mithral-current/) maneuvers known"
  "two [Solar Wind](/martial-disciplines/solar-wind/) maneuvers known"
]
benefit: "You can gain the effects of [Solar Wind](/martial-disciplines/solar-wind/) boosts when initiating [Mithral Current](/martial-disciplines/mithral-current/) strikes that allow you to attack enemies at range as a melee attack, even if those boosts would normally only function for ranged attacks. When you do so, you increase the range of the Mithral Current strike by 10 feet plus an additional 5 feet per four initiator levels you possess."
normal: "Mithral Current strikes that attack enemies at range are still melee attacks, and as such would not gain the benefits of Solar Wind's boosts."

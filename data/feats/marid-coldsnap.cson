benefit: '''
  While using [Marid Style](/feats/marid-style/), as a standard action, you can spend two [Elemental Fist](/feats/elemental-fist/) attempts to unleash a 30-foot line of frigid water. Creatures caught in the line take your unarmed strike damage plus the cold damage from your [Elemental Fist](/feats/elemental-fist/) attack and are entangled in ice as per the [Marid Spirit](/feats/marid-spirit/) feat. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier) reduces the damage by half and prevents a target from becoming entangled.

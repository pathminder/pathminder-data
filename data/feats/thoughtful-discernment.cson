flavor_text: "Thinking back, you discover a lie in what you once thought to be words of truth."
prerequisites: [
  "discern lies class feature"

benefit: '''
  Once per day as a free action, you can think back about a single statement you heard in the last day and determine if it was a lie. This acts like the [*discern lies*](/spells/discern-lies/) spell, but instead of affecting a creature, it affects a single statement a creature has made.
  
  For example, if the king told you, "My daughter is in the monster's dungeon" before you left to find her, as long as the king said that to you within the past day, you can use this feat to determine whether or not the king deliberately and knowingly lied to you when he made that statement.

benefit: '''
  Whenever you confirm a critical hit, you can also affect the target as if you had succeeded at a dirty trick combat maneuver check. Doing so normally causes the target to suffer for 1 round one of the conditions applied by a dirty trick, unless you have feats or abilities that give you more dirty trick options.

special: '''
  You can apply the effects of only one critical feat to a given critical hit unless you possess [Critical Mastery](/feats/critical-mastery/).

prerequisites: [
  "no levels in a class that has the panache class feature"
]
benefit: '''
  You gain a small amount of panache and the ability to perform a single 1st-level swashbuckler deed. Choose a 1st-level deed from the swashbuckler's deeds class feature (you can't select opportune parry and riposte). Once chosen, this deed can't be changed.

  At the start of each day, you gain 1 panache point. Throughout the day, you can gain a number of panache points, up to a maximum equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). You can regain panache points as the swashbuckler's panache class feature. You can spend these points to perform the 1st-level deed you chose upon taking this feat as well as any other deeds you have gained through feats or magic items.
'''
special: '''
  If you later gain levels in a class that has the panache class feature, you can immediately trade this feat for the [Extra Panache](/feats/extra-panache/) feat.

  As long as you have 1 *ki* point in your *ki* pool, when you fail your Constitution check to stabilize, you do not lose 1 hit point. If you succeed at the check, you can spend 1 *ki* point to heal 1d6 hit points. If you roll a natural 20 on the check to stabilize, you can spend 1 *ki* point to heal 2d6 hit points of damage instead.

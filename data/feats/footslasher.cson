flavor_text: "You are trained to strike at a large foe's feet to impede its movement and cause great pain."
benefit: '''
  If you damage a foe that is of a larger size category than you with a weapon that does piercing or slashing damage, you can attempt to damage the creature's feet in a way that impedes its movement. Attacking a foe in this way is a standard action---you cannot use Footslasher as part of a full-attack action. When you use Footslasher, you take a â€“2 penalty on your attack roll, but if you hit and deal at least 1 point of damage to the target, it is affected as if by caltrops---its speed is reduced by half. This penalty lasts for 24 hours, or until the creature is successfully treated with a DC 15 Heal check or receives at least 1 point of magical healing. Footslasher does not stack with itself---once a foe has been wounded by this attack, its speed cannot be further reduced by additional attacks (or by damage from caltrops).

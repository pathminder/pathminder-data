flavor_text: "You can befuddle a foe by striking a blow after tumbling."
prerequisites: [
  "[Amateur Swashbuckler](/feats/amateur-swashbuckler/) feat or panache class feature"
  "[Canny Tumble](/feats/canny-tumble/)"
  "[Acrobatics](/skills/acrobatics/) 7 ranks"
]
benefit: '''
  When you use [Acrobatics](/skills/acrobatics/) to move through an opponent's threatened area or space without provoking an attack of opportunity from that opponent and then hit that foe with a melee attack in the same round, as a free action you can spend 1 panache point to deny that foe its Dexterity bonus to its Armor Class until the end of your next turn.

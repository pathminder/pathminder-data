flavor_text: "You can manipulate the luminescence of magic weapons."
prerequisites: [
  "Use Magic Device 5 ranks"
  "ability to cast [*darkness*](/spells/darkness/)"

benefit: '''
  When wielding a magic weapon that sheds light or that features a luminescent quality, such as a *flaming* or *brilliant energy* weapon, you can deactivate that illumination as a swift action. You can reignite the illumination at any time as a free action. Any intrinsic magic properties that would force the weapon to shed light, such as the extra damage of a *flaming* weapon, do not function while the illumination is deactivated, and the "significant portion" of a* brilliant energy* weapon that is normally made oflight ceases to exist.
  
  If a weapon affected by this ability ever leaves your possession (for instance, if you drop the weapon or pass it to another creature), its illumination and related abilities instantly return.

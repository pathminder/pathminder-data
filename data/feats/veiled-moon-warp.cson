summary: "Expend a strike to make a special attack that renders the target incorporeal"
flavor_text: "Your strikes can force an enemy into the aether for a short time."

benefit: "As a standard action, you may expend one of your readied strikes and make a melee attack against an opponent. If it hits, deal weapon damage as normal and the target must succeed at a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your highest initiation modifier) or become incorporeal for one round. The target's equipment does not become incorporeal, though it remains on their body, effectively rendering them incapable of using any items that do not have the *ghost touch* property or an equivalent effect. This is a supernatural ability."

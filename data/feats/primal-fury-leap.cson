benefit: "You can make charge attacks against opponents in the air. If you do, you are treated as having a fly speed equal to your land speed during the charge, with good maneuverability. If you do not normally have a fly speed, you fall after this charge. You reduce the effective distance of this fall by 10 feet per initiator level."

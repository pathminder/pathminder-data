  When you confirm a critical hit with a spell or spell-like ability, you may cast [*bestow curse*](/spells/bestow-curse/) or [*major curse*](/spells/major-curse/) on that target as an immediate action. This works even with ranged spells. You must have [*bestow curse*](/spells/bestow-curse/) or [*major curse*](/spells/major-curse/) prepared or otherwise available to cast, and using this ability casts the corresponding spell.

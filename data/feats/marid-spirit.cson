  "[Elemental Fist](/feats/elemental-fist/)"

benefit: '''
  You gain one additional [Elemental Fist](/feats/elemental-fist/) attempt per day. While using [Marid Style](/feats/marid-style/), you gain cold resistance equal to your base attack bonus, or monk level plus base attack bonus gained from levels in classes other than monk, whichever is higher. While denied your Dexterity bonus to AC you are also denied this resistance. Creatures that take cold damage from your [Elemental Fist](/feats/elemental-fist/) attack must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier) or become entangled in ice for 1d4 rounds. The ice has hit points equal to three times your base attack bonus or monk level, whichever is higher, and a break DC of 15 + your base attack bonus or monk level, whichever is higher. Destroying or breaking the ice ends the entangled condition.

prerequisites: [
  "[Perception](/skills/perception/) 15 ranks"
  "[Improved Blind-Fight](/feats/improved-blind-fight/)"
]
benefit: '''
  Your melee attacks ignore the miss chance for less than total concealment, and you treat opponents with total concealment as if they had normal concealment (20% miss chance instead of 50%). You may still reroll a miss chance percentile roll as normal.
  
  If you successfully pinpoint an invisible or hidden attacker, that attacker gets no advantages related to hitting you with ranged attacks, regardless of the range. That is, you don't lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class, and the attacker doesn't get the usual +2 bonus for being invisible.
'''
special: '''
  The Greater Blind-Fight feat is of no use against a character who is the subject of a [*blink*](/spells/blink/) spell.

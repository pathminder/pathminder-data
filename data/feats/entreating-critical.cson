benefit: '''
  Whenever you confirm a critical hit, the shock of the attack momentarily opens an opportunity to end hostilities with a quick entreaty. As an immediate action immediately after confirming the critical hit, you can attempt a Diplomacy check to improve the target's attitude as though you had spent 1 full round using the Call Truce feat. All other conditions and limitations of the Call Truce feat apply.

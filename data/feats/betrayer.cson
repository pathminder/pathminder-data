benefit: '''
  When you succeed at a [Diplomacy](/skills/diplomacy/) check to change a creature's attitude, you can draw a weapon and make a single melee attack against that creature as an immediate action. If you changed your target's attitude to friendly or better, your target is considered flat-footed against this attack. If the target survives, it takes a --2 penalty on its initiative check for this combat.

  Once you attack a creature, its attitude becomes hostile.

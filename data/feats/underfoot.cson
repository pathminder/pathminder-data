  You receive a +4 dodge bonus on [Acrobatics](/skills/acrobatics/) checks to move past opponents without provoking attacks of opportunity, so long as they are larger than you. In addition, you gain a +2 dodge bonus to Armor Class against attacks of opportunity caused when you move out of or within a larger opponent's threatened area (this stacks with the +4 bonus provided by [Mobility](/feats/mobility/), for a total bonus of +6).

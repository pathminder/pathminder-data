benefit: '''
  You can flatter a creature in a protracted interaction (taking at least 1 minute) to bestow in them an inflated sense of self worth that muddles their judgment. At the end of the tirade of flattery, attempt a Bluff check against a DC equal to 10 + the creature's HD + the creature's Wisdom modifier or equal to 10 + the creature's Sense Motive modifier, whichever is higher. If you succeed, the target takes a --2 penalty on Will saving throws, Wisdom-based skill checks, and Wisdom ability checks for 1 hour plus an additional hour for every 5 by which your result exceeds the DC. The target can remove the effect early by taking 10 minutes to compose herself. If you fail this check, any creature who witnesses the failure is immune to your flattery from this feat for 24 hours. If you fail by 5 or more, the target's attitude toward you decreases by 1 step.

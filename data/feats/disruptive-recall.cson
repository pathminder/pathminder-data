benefit: '''
  When you use a melee attack to successfully disrupt an arcane spellcaster's spell, you can immediately use your spell recall class feature to regain a magus spell you have already cast. This ability functions as if you had expended a number of points from your arcane pool equal to the level of the spell you disrupted, up to the maximum level spell you can cast.

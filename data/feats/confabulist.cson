benefit: '''
  When you fail to deceive someone with a Bluff check, you can immediately attempt another version of the same basic deception against that creature at a --5 penalty by downplaying the failed Bluff and quickly moving on to another one. You cannot use this ability if the first Bluff was so egregious that further checks would have been impossible (as per the Bluff skill). If you fail the second attempt, you cannot retry the Bluff check and all further attempts to perpetrate that particular deception are impossible.
'''
normal: '''
  When you fail a Bluff check against a creature, that creature is innately suspicious. You take a --10 penalty on future attempts to deceive that creature, or at the GM's discretion, such attempts may be impossible.

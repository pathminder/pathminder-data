  A number of times per day equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1), when you use [Vital Strike](/feats/vital-strike/) (or [Improved Vital Strike](/feats/improved-vital-strike/) or [Greater Vital Strike](/feats/greater-vital-strike/)), your strike saps the strength of your opponent. The creature hit must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier) or become fatigued for a number of rounds equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). You can choose to use this ability as a free action after you hit the target with the attack. This is a supernatural ability.

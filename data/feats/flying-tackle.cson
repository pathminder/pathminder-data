benefit: '''
  When attempting an overrun combat maneuver check against a flat-footed opponent, if the attempt knocks the creature prone, you can also fall prone in order to attempt a grapple combat maneuver check against the creature as a free action. Doing so does not provoke an attack of opportunity from the target of your grapple.

flavor_text: "With a surprise swipe with your pommel, you can topple a foe."
prerequisites: [
  "[Amateur Swashbuckler](/feats/amateur-swashbuckler/) or panache class feature; base attack bonus +3"
]
benefit: '''
  You can spend 1 panache point to make a melee attack with the pommel of a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon as a standard action. You make this attack as if you were using the weapon normally (including any bonuses gained from the swashbuckler's finesse class feature, [Weapon Finesse](/feats/weapon-finesse/), or other similar feats and effects), but you deal 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage (or 1d4 if you are Small) instead of the weapon's normal damage. Regardless of your size, the critical threat range and critical multiplier of this attack are 20/Ã—2, and they are not affected by [Improved Critical](/feats/improved-critical/), the *keen* weapon special ability, or similar effects. If the attack hits, you can attempt a combat maneuver check to knock the target prone as a free action.

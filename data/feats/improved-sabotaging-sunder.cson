benefit: '''
  You do not provoke an attack of opportunity when performing the special sunder combat maneuver from the Sabotaging Sunder feat. In addition, you can attempt to use that maneuver on items held by the target, but you still cannot do so against items hidden in a bag, a pack, or another container.

flavor_text: "The spirit of the dragon wells up inside you and bursts forth in a mighty roar."
prerequisites: [
  "Str 15"
  "[Improved Unarmed Strike](/feats/improved-unarmed-strike/)"
  "[Dragon Style](/feats/dragon-style/)"
  "[Stunning Fist](/feats/stunning-fist/)"
  "[Acrobatics](/skills/acrobatics/) 8 ranks"
]
benefit: '''
  You gain one additional [Stunning Fist](/feats/stunning-fist/) attempt per day. While using [Dragon Style](/feats/dragon-style/), as a standard action you can expend two [Stunning Fist](/feats/stunning-fist/) attempts to unleash a concussive roar in a 15-foot cone. Creatures caught in the cone take your unarmed strike damage and become shaken for 1d4 rounds. A successful Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier) reduces the damage by half and prevents a target from being shaken.
'''
special: '''
  If you have the [Elemental Fist](/feats/elemental-fist/) feat, you can expend a daily use of that feat to deal your [Elemental Fist](/feats/elemental-fist/) damage to those caught in the cone. This damage is not halved even on a save.

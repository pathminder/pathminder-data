summary: "Your ranged attacks deal additional fire damage and outline creatures with *faerie fire*"
flavor_text: "Your arrows glow as bright as the sun."
prerequisites: [
  "Perception 3 ranks"
  "one [Solar Wind](/martial-disciplines/solar-wind/) stance known"
]
benefit: "Your ranged attacks deal 1 point of additional fire damage. At character level 5th and at every five levels thereafter, this damage increases by 1. In addition, whenever you hit a creature with a ranged attack, you can choose to have your target become outlined as if by a *faerie fire* spell, with a caster level equal to the your initiator level. Successive uses of this ability against the same creature do not stack; instead, they extend the duration. You can suppress or resume the light on an affected creature you can see as a free action. This is a supernatural ability."
special: "Unlike normal style feats, this style feat can be used with any weapon, and isn't limited to unarmed strikes."

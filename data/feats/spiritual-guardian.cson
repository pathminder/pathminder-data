flavor_text: "Your spiritual guardians are unusually powerful."

]
benefit: '''
  Whenever you cast [*spiritual weapon*](/spells/spiritual-weapon/), [*spiritual ally*](/spells/spiritual-ally/), or a similar spell that grants you a spiritual guardian, that guardian uses your shaman level instead of your base attack bonus to determine its base attack bonus, potentially granting it multiple attacks. Additionally, it gains a +2 bonus on caster level checks to overcome spell resistance as well as on damage rolls.

benefit: '''
  You can trip a creature of the giant subtype no matter its size. While you are using [Earth Child Style](/feats/earth-child-style/), when a prone creature of the giant subtype stands up and provokes an attack of opportunity from you, if you make an unarmed strike, you can declare you are making a [Stunning Fist](/feats/stunning-fist/) attempt after the attack hits. You gain a +4 bonus to the DC of any [Stunning Fist](/feats/stunning-fist/) effect you deliver in this way.
'''
normal: '''
  You can only trip opponents who are one size category larger than you.

benefit: '''
  You gain a small amount of grit and the ability to perform a single 1st-level deed from the gunslinger deed class feature. At the start of the day, you gain 1 grit point, though throughout the day you can gain grit points up to a maximum of your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). You can regain grit using the rules for the gunslinger's grit class feature. You can spend this grit to perform the 1st-level deed you chose upon taking this feat, and any other deed you have gained through feats or magic items.

special: '''
  If you gain levels in a class that grants the grit class feature, you can immediately trade this feat for the [Extra Grit](/feats/extra-grit/) feat.

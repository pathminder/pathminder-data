prerequisites: [
  "[Improved Unarmed Strike](/feats/improved-unarmed-strike/)"
  "[Power Attack](/feats/power-attack/)"

benefit: '''
  While using the [Tiger Style](/feats/tiger-style/) feat, you can apply the penalty from [Power Attack](/feats/power-attack/) to your AC instead of attack rolls. Additionally, once per round as a swift action, you can move up to half your speed closer to a target you hit with an unarmed strike or made a successful combat maneuver against on this turn or your last turn.

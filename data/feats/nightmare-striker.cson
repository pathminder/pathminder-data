flavor_text: "Your [*faerie fire*](/spells/faerie-fire/) not only illuminates your foes, but it also shows you their weaknesses."
prerequisites: [
  "[Improved Unarmed Strike](/feats/improved-unarmed-strike/)"
  "[Nightmare Fist](/feats/nightmare-fist/)"
  "[Nightmare Weaver](/feats/nightmare-weaver/)"
  "[Stunning Fist](/feats/stunning-fist/)"
  "[Heal](/skills/heal/) 5 ranks"
  "ability to cast [*faerie fire*](/spells/faerie-fire/)."
]
benefit: '''
  While a [*faerie fire*](/spells/faerie-fire/) you have cast (not one cast from a spell completion or spell trigger item) outlines an opponent, the DC for that opponent to resist your [Stunning Fist](/feats/stunning-fist/) attempts increases by +2. If you hit an opponent with a [Stunning Fist](/feats/stunning-fist/) attempt, and that opponent fails her saving throw, you can render the target shaken for 1d2 rounds plus 1 round for every 5 by which the opponent failed her save.

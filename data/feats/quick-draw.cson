benefit: '''
  You can draw a weapon as a free action instead of as a move action. You can draw a hidden weapon (see the [Sleight of Hand](/skills/sleight-of-hand/) skill) as a move action.
  
  A character who has selected this feat may throw weapons at his full normal rate of attacks (much like a character with a bow).
  
  Alchemical items, potions, scrolls, and wands cannot be drawn quickly using this feat.

normal: '''
  Without this feat, you may draw a weapon as a move action, or (if your base attack bonus is +1 or higher) as a free action as part of movement. Without this feat, you can draw a hidden weapon as a standard action.

  "base attack bonus +6"

benefit: '''
  As a standard action, make a single unarmed melee attack against a foe whose speed is reduced (such as from [Scorpion Style](/feats/scorpion-style/)). If the attack hits, you deal damage normally and the target is staggered until the end of your next turn unless it makes a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier). This feat has no effect on targets that are staggered.

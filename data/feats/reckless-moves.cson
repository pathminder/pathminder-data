benefit: '''
  If you are adjacent to an ally who also has this feat, you can initiate this feat as a free action to use the ally as a counterweight to improve your balance, which requires you to push or pull her slightly. You gain a +4 bonus on Acrobatics, Climb, and Stealth checks until you cease using this feat as a free action or you move away from the ally. The abettor is kept off balance and takes a â€“2 penalty on Acrobatics, Climb, and Stealth checks as long as this feat remains in effect. You can initiate this feat as an immediate action while you are falling or being knocked prone in order to switch places with the abettor, moving her into your former space and moving yourself into her former space. If you do, you and the abettor each end this movement prone unless you succeed at an Acrobatics check with a DC of 20 (the bonuses and penalties for this feat apply). If you were falling, the abettor is falling instead. If you or the abettor were climbing, the other person must succeed at a Climb check against the surface's normal DC to grab on and avoid falling. Switching places provokes attacks of opportunity for the abettor only.

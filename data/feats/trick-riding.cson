flavor_text: "You are not only skilled at controlling a horse in combat; you can make it look like art."
prerequisites: [
  "[Ride](/skills/ride/) 9 ranks"
  "[Mounted Combat](/feats/mounted-combat/)"
]
benefit: '''
  While wearing light or no armor, you do not need to make [Ride](/skills/ride/) skill with a DC of 15 or lower. You do not take a --5 penalty for riding a mount bareback. You can make a check using [Mounted Combat](/feats/mounted-combat/) to negate a hit on your mount twice per round instead of just once.

flavor_text: "Your magical energies cling to enemies, interfering with their spellcasting."
benefit: '''
  Targets affected by a disruptive spell must make concentration checks when using spells or spell-like abilities (DC equals the save DC of the disruptive spell plus the level of the spell being cast) for 1 round. Targets that avoid the spell's effects avoid this feat's effect as well.
  
  A disruptive spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.

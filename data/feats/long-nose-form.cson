flavor_text: "You can shift into the form of a human with an unusually long nose."
prerequisites: [
  "character level 3rd"
  "[tengu](/races/tengus/)"
]
benefit: '''
  Once per day, you can assume the form of a human whose nose is the length of your beak. This spell-like ability functions as [*alter self*](/spells/alter-self/) with a caster level equal to your level. While in this form you gain the scent ability and a +2 bonus to your Strength score. Because your long nose in this form clearly indicates you are not fully human, you do not gain the normal bonus to Disguise checks for using a polymorph effect (however, you could possibly explain the nose as an unfortunate curse or deformity, or hide it with an item such as a plague doctor's mask).

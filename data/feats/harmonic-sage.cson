benefit: '''
  While inside an artificial structure, you can spend a free action to make a DC 15 [Knowledge (engineering)](/skills/knowledge-engineering/) check when you begin your bardic performance. Success on this check allows you to do one of the following.
  
  *Self-Harmonize:* By performing over the acoustic reverberations of your performance, you increase the DC of your bardic performance effects +1.
  
  *Reverberation:* You can choose to have the effect of your current bardic performance continue for 1 round after you cease maintaining it, regardless of why you cease maintaining it. You can still have no more than one bardic performance in effect at one time.
'''
normal: '''
  A bardic performance lasts only as long as you maintain it.

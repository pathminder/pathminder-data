flavor_text: "Be they students, retainers, new recruits to your order, or neophyte members of your faith, you have access to a small set of dedicated servants."
prerequisites: [
  "Cha 13"
  "character level 5th"
]
benefit: '''
  You gain a number of cohorts (as per the [Leadership](/feats/leadership/) feat) that represent NPCs you are responsible for instructing and overseeing. You have a number of such cohorts equal to half your character level. Unlike normal cohorts, these recruits must be at least 4 levels lower than your level. Since these recruits must spend most of their time studying and gaining experience, only one recruit can travel with you at a time (though they all gain experience at the same rate, as those not present are assumed to be studying and growing independently). Whenever you are in a major town or city, you can exchange the recruit currently accompanying you for a different member of your recruits.

  As recruits are busy learning and studying the basics of their careers, those not traveling with you canâ€™t engage in mundane or magical crafting or Profession checks. Recruits not traveling with you can, however, serve as managers for your holdings if you are using the downtime rules. If a recruit dies, you take only a --1 penalty to your Leadership score.

  **Special:** The Recruits feat counts as the Leadership feat for purposes of fulfilling prerequisites. A character cannot have both Leadership and Recruits. A character with Recruits who later qualifies for Leadership can exchange this feat for Leadership immediately upon qualifying (selecting one minor cohort to become a full cohort, while the rest move on).

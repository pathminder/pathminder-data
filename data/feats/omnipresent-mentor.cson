prerequisites: [
  "Cha 17"

  "inspire competence bardic performance"
]
benefit: '''
  By expending 4 rounds of your bardic performance at the start of the day, you can instill one ally with your inspiring words. Select one skill in which you possess ranks. Your ally gains the benefits of your inspire competence bardic performance, regardless of distance, until the next time you replenish rounds of bardic performance. This doesn't count as an active performance, so the effects don't end if you start another performance. Only one ally can be affected by this ability at a time; if you use this ability again before the duration expires, the ally currently affected loses the bonuses from this feat.

benefit: '''
  When you gain this feat, choose one domain-granted power that you can use to affect no more than one opponent. If you make a successful unarmed strike against an opponent, in addition to dealing your unarmed strike damage, you can use a swift action to deliver the effects of the chosen granted power to that opponent. Doing so provokes no attacks of opportunity.
'''
special: '''
  You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you take it, you apply it to a different qualifying domain power.

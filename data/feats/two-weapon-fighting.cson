  Your penalties on attack rolls for fighting with two weapons are reduced. The penalty for your primary hand lessens by 2 and the one for your off hand lessens by 6.

normal: '''
  If you wield a second weapon in your off hand, you can get one extra attack per round with that weapon. When fighting in this way you suffer a --6 penalty with your regular attack or attacks with your primary hand and a --10 penalty to the attack with your off hand. If your off-hand weapon is light, the penalties are reduced by 2 each. An unarmed strike is always considered light.

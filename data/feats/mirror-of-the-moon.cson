benefit: "Whenever you initiate a maneuver that allows you to teleport, you leave behind an illusory duplicate of yourself in the space you teleport from. This duplicate functions as a *major image* spell with a caster level equal to your initiator level, except that it only lasts for one round and does not require you to concentrate to maintain or direct it. You can only create a single duplicate with this feat at any given time. This is a supernatural ability."

flavor_text: "A strike made with a two-handed weapon can push a similar sized opponent backward."
prerequisites: [
  "Str 15"
  "[Power Attack](/feats/power-attack/)"
  "base attack bonus +1"
]
benefit: '''
  When you hit a creature your size or smaller with a two-handed weapon attack modified by the [Power Attack](/feats/power-attack/) feat, you can choose to push the target 5 feet directly away from you instead of dealing the extra damage from [Power Attack](/feats/power-attack/). If you score a critical hit, you can instead push the target 10 feet directly away from you. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunities, and the target must end this move in a safe space it can stand in. You choose which effect to apply after the attack roll has been made, but before the damage is rolled.

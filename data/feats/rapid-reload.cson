flavor_text: "You can reload a given kind of ranged weapon quickly."
prerequisites: [
  "Weapon Proficiency (crossbow type chosen) or [Exotic Weapon Proficiency](/feats/exotic-weapon-proficiency/) (firearm)"
]
benefit: '''
  Choose a type of crossbow (hand, light, heavy) or a single type of one-handed or two-handed firearm that you are proficient with.
  
  The time required for you to reload your chosen type of weapon is reduced to a free action (for a hand or light crossbow), a move action (for heavy crossbow or one-handed firearm), or a standard action (two-handed firearm). Reloading a crossbow or firearm still provokes attacks of opportunity.
  
  If you have selected this feat for a hand crossbow or light crossbow, you may fire that weapon as many times in a full-attack action as you could attack if you were using a bow.
'''
normal: '''
  A character without this feat needs a move action to reload a hand or light crossbow, a standard action to reload a one-handed firearm, or a full-round action to load a heavy crossbow or a two-handed firearm.
'''
special: '''
  You can gain [Rapid Reload](/feats/rapid-reload/) multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new type of crossbow or a new type of firearm.

benefit: '''
  While using [Two-Weapon Fighting](/feats/two-weapon-fighting/) to make melee attacks, you can forgo your first primary-hand melee attack to make a [Bluff](/skills/bluff/) check to feint an opponent. If you successfully feint, that opponent is denied his Dexterity bonus to AC until the end of your turn.

flavor_text: "You enhance your deathly nature, granting you some measure of control."
prerequisites: [
  "[Mixed Blood](/feats/mixed-blood/) (undead) and/or graveblood subtype"
]
benefit: '''
  You may choose to count as undead only if it would be advantageous to you when resolving the effects of spells and abilities (you still do not gain undead immunities unless you are actually undead). Once per day you may drain your own life force to gain power; as a swift action you suffer a -4 penalty to your Constitution and gain a +4 untyped bonus to another ability score of your choice. Both bonus and penalty last for up to 1 minute.

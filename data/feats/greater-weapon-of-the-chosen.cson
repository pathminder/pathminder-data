  When you use your deity's favored weapon to attempt a single attack with the attack action, you roll two dice for your attack roll and take the higher result. You do not need to use your [Weapon of the Chosen](/feats/weapon-of-the-chosen/) feat to gain this feat's benefit. As usual, the reroll does not apply to any confirmation rolls.

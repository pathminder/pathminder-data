flavor_text: "Your magical creations are infused with divine power."
prerequisites: [
  "[Craft Magic Arms and Armor](/feats/craft-magic-arms-and-armor/)"
  "ability to cast [*consecrate*](/spells/consecrate/) or [*desecrate*](/spells/desecrate/)."
]
benefit: '''
  When you craft a magic weapon, magic armor, or magic shield, you may add one casting of [*consecrate*](/spells/consecrate/) or [*desecrate*](/spells/desecrate/) as part of the item crafting process. This increases the item's price by 250 gp. The item becomes a reliquary and can be used as a holy (or unholy) symbol divine focus of your deity. If you cast [*consecrate*](/spells/consecrate/) or [*desecrate*](/spells/desecrate/), your reliquary counts as a permanent fixture for that spell while it remains in the spell's area.

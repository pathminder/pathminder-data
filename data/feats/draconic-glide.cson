flavor_text: "You possess draconic defenses and wings that allow you to glide."
prerequisites: [
  "[Draconic Aspect](/feats/draconic-aspect/)"
  "[kobold](/races/kobolds/)"
]
benefit: '''
  You gain a +2 bonus against sleep and paralysis effects. You grow a pair of wings that you can use to fall and glide at a safe pace. You can make a DC 15 Fly check to fall safely from any height without taking falling damage, as if using [*feather fall*](/feats/feather-fall/). When falling safely, you may make an additional DC 15 Fly check to glide, moving 5 feet laterally for every 20 feet you fall.
'''
special: '''
  If you have the gliding wings racial trait, you donâ€™t need to make a Fly check to glide, and you can move 10 feet laterally for every 20 feet you fall.

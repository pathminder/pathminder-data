flavor_text: "You can modify a spell to become more tenacious when its targets resist its effect."
benefit: '''
  Whenever a creature targeted by a persistent spell or within its area succeeds on its saving throw against the spell, it must make another saving throw against the effect. If a creature fails this second saving throw, it suffers the full effects of the spell, as if it had failed its first saving throw.
  
  A persistent spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell's actual level. Spells that do not require a saving throw to resist or lessen the spell's effect do not benefit from this feat.

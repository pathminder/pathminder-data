benefit: '''
  When you attempt a Strength check to break an object that can shatter (nothing made of paper, cloth, leather, or other soft, pliable material), you gain a bonus on the Strength check equal to your base attack bonus. If you surpass the object's break DC, you can send shards of its material flying out in all directions, dealing an amount of piercing, slashing, and bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 plus 1 point per point of the object's hardness to all creatures within 10 feet of the object, including yourself. A successful Reflex save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Strength modifier) halves the damage.

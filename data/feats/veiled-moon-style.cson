benefit: "Whenever you move, you can treat up to 10 feet of that movement as teleportation. This teleportation may be taken at any point during your movement, and cannot exceed the total movement you would normally be allowed to make. You must have line of sight to your destination, and cannot teleport into an occupied space. This is a supernatural ability."
special: "You can use this feat to bypass a 5 feet worth of obstacles when making a charge; you treat a square you bypass as empty for the purposes of determining if you can charge your target. Unlike normal style feats, this style feat can be used with any weapon, and isn't limited to unarmed strikes."

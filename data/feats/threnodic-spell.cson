benefit: '''
  This feat only works on mind-affecting spells. A threnodic spell affects undead creatures (even mindless undead) as if they weren't immune to mind-affecting effects, but has no effect on living creatures.
  
  A threnodic spell uses up a spell slot two level higher than the spell's actual level.

flavor_text: "Unusually small and nimble for your race, you can squeeze into tight places."
prerequisites: [
  "base attack bonus +3"
  "elf, gnome, goblinoid, halfling or reptilian subtype and/or aberration, fey, or ooze type"
]
benefit: '''
  You gain the flexible frame special quality, which allows you to function in many ways as though you were one size smaller.
  
  If you would be subject to a size modifier or a special size modifier for an opposed check (such as Stealth), you are treated as being one size smaller if it is advantageous to you.
  
  You are considered to be one size smaller when "squeezing through" restrictive spaces, and may use weapons designed for creatures one size smaller without penalty. Your space and reach remain that of a creature your actual size. The effects of this ability stack with those of abilities, powers, and spells that change the subject's size.

flavor_text: "You know how to get the most out of bribes."
Prerequisite: "Persuasive."
benefit: '''
  You gain a +2 bonus on Diplomacy checks when attempting to bribe someone and on Diplomacy or Charisma checks to bargain with a conjured creature (such as with [*planar ally*](/spells/planar-ally/) or [*planar binding*](/spells/planar-binding/)), in addition to any bonus granted by the bribe itself. The first time someone refuses a bribe you offer, that person's attitude toward you doesn't worsen, even if the offer would normally offend the person.

flavor_text: "You can deliver poisons deep into a foe's flesh."
prerequisites: [
  "[Vital Strike](/feats/vital-strike/)"
  "base attack bonus +6"
  "Craft (poison) 6 ranks or poison use class feature"
]
benefit: '''
  When you use a poisoned weapon to make a [Vital Strike](/feats/vital-strike/), you increase the poison's duration by one frequency increment (for example, a dose of large scorpion venom would last for 7 rounds instead of 6 and a dose of drow poison would last for 3 minutes instead of 2). The poison takes effect immediately and does not have an onset time.

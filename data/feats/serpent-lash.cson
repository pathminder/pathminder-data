benefit: '''
  As a standard action, you can make a disarm or trip maneuver with your whip. If it succeeds, you can make an additional disarm or trip maneuver with the same bonus against a target adjacent to the first and also within your whip's reach.
  
  In addition, you can use your whip to perform reposition maneuvers, though you take a --4 penalty on your CMB and you may only move the target toward you from its original position.

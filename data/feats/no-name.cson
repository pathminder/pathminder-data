  You often rely on surprise and misdirection in your social dealings. You gain a +2 bonus on [Bluff](/skills/bluff/) checks, and you can spend 1 grit point to gain a +10 bonus on [Disguise](/skills/disguise/) checks for 10 minutes per your gunslinger level (minimum 10 minutes). This deed does not actually change your appearance, but rather allows you to hide your identity in other ways.

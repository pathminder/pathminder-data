benefit: '''
  While using the [Shaitan Style](/feats/shaitan-style/) feat, as a standard action, you can spend two [Elemental Fist](/feats/elemental-fist/) attempts to unleash a 20-foot column of acid that has a 5-foot radius and erupts from a point of origin within 30 feet of you. Creatures caught in the column take your unarmed strike damage plus the acid damage from your [Elemental Fist](/feats/elemental-fist/) and are staggered for 1 round. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier) reduces the damage by half and prevents a target from being staggered.

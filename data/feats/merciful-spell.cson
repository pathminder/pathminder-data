flavor_text: "Your damaging spells subdue rather than kill."
benefit: '''
  You can alter spells that inflict damage to inflict nonlethal damage instead. Spells that inflict damage of a particular type (such as fire) inflict nonlethal damage of that same type.
  
  A merciful spell does not use up a higher-level spell slot than the spell's actual level.

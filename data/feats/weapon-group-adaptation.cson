summary: "Add weapons to discipline weapon group"
flavor_text: "You specialize in a specific family of weaponry, adapting many techniques to suit them."
benefit: "Choose a weapon group (excluding siege weapons and siege firearms). That weapon group is considered associated with disciplines you have access to. Note that this does not change the initiation requirements of maneuvers from those disciplines. For example, a warlord who takes this feat might have heavy blades associated with [Solar Wind](/martial-disciplines/solar-wind/), but still cannot make a ranged attack with them without further feats or abilities that allow him to use a heavy blade as a ranged weapon."
special: "This may be taken multiple times."

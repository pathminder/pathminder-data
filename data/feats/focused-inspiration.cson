benefit: '''
  When you take this feat, choose two skills that you either are trained in or can use untrained. You must be able to use inspiration with these skills. When you use inspiration on checks involving those skills, roll a d8 instead of a d6, or a d10 if you would normally roll a d8. If you have the true inspiration class feature, you roll twice as many such dice (2d8 or 2d10) as normal.

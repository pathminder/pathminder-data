benefit: '''
  You gain defensive abilities related to your patron's outsider subtype. For example, if your patron is a devil, the abilities listed below tie into the devil subtype. These benefits tie to your patron's subtype, not your specific patron (its abilities might differ from the norm).
  
  *One Damnation Feat:* Choose one of the energy types to which your patron's outsider subtype grants resistance. You gain resistance 5 against that energy type.
  
  *Two Damnation Feats:* Choose one of the energy types to which your patron's outsider subtype grants resistance. You gain resistance 5 against that energy type. If you already have resistance to the chosen energy type (even from earlier benefits of this feat), this new resistance stacks with the existing resistance.
  
  *Three Damnation Feats:* Choose one of the energy types to which your patron's outsider subtype grants resistance. You gain immunity to the selected energy type.
  
  *Four Damnation Feats:* Your creature type changes to outsider (native). Additionally, choose one energy type to which your patron's outsider subtype grants immunity or resistance. You gain immunity to that energy type.

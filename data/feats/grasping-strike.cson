flavor_text: "The surrounding foliage lurches forth at your enemies in concert with your strikes."
prerequisites: [
  "[Nature Magic](/feats/nature-magic/) or the ability to cast druid or ranger spells"
  "[Vital Strike](/feats/vital-strike/)"
  "[Knowledge](/skills/knowledge/) (nature) 5 ranks"
]
benefit: '''
  When you use [Vital Strike](/feats/vital-strike/) (or [Improved Vital Strike](/feats/improved-vital-strike/) or [Greater Vital Strike](/feats/greater-vital-strike/)), you cause the foliage in the area to reach out and entangle your foe (as the condition) if it fails a Reflex save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier). The effect lasts for 1 minute or until the enemy breaks free with a successful Strength check or an [Escape Artist](/skills/escape-artist/) check (DC = the effect's saving throw DC), whichever comes first.
  
  You can use this benefit a number of times per day equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). You can use this ability as a free action after you hit an enemy with an attack. This is a supernatural ability.

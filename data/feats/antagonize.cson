benefit: '''
  You can make [Diplomacy](/skills/diplomacy/) and [Intimidate](/skills/intimidate/) checks to make creatures respond to you with hostility. No matter which skill you use, antagonizing a creature takes a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and has a DC equal to 10+ the target's Hit Dice + the target's Wisdom modifier. You cannot make this check against a creature that does not understand you or has an Intelligence score of 3 or lower. Before you make these checks, you may make a [Sense Motive](/skills/sense-motive/) check (DC 20) as a swift action to gain an insight bonus on these [Diplomacy](/skills/diplomacy/) or Intimitade checks equal to your Charisma bonus until the end of your next turn. The benefits you gain for this check depend on the skill you use. This is a mind-affecting effect.

  *[Diplomacy](/skills/diplomacy/):* You fluster your enemy. For the next minute, the target takes a --2 penalty on all attacks rolls made against creatures other than you and has a 10% spell failure chance on all spells that do not target you or that have you within their area of effect.

  *[Intimidate](/skills/intimidate/):* The creature flies into a rage. On its next turn, the target must attempt to make a melee attack against you, make a ranged attack against you, target you with a spell, or include you in the area of a spell. The effect ends if the creature is prevented from attacking you or attempting to do so would harm it (for example, if you are on the other side of a chasm or a [*wall of fire*](/spells/wall-of-fire/)). If it cannot attack you on its turn, you may make the check again as an immediate action to extend the effect for 1 round (but cannot extend it thereafter). The effect ends as soon as the creature attacks you. Once you have targeted a creature with this ability, you cannot target it again for 1 day.

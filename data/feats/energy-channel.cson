benefit: '''
  As a swift action, you can expend one use of channel energy to grant your weapon attacks a bonus on damage rolls equal to twice the number of dice rolled for your channel energy. This additional damage is of an energy type determined by your domain or blessing: acid (Earth), cold (Water), electricity (Air), or fire (Fire). If you have more than one of those domains or blessings, you choose one of those damage types each time you use this ability. This effect lasts for your next three weapon attacks or until the end of the combat encounter, whichever comes first.

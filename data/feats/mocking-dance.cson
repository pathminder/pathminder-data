  When you spend a swift action to make a [performance combat](/systems/performance-combat/) check, before making that check you can either move 5 feet without provoking attacks of opportunity, or you can move your speed and provoke attacks of opportunity. You cannot end this move in a space where you threaten an enemy. If you do move at least 5 feet, you gain a +2 bonus on the [performance combat](/systems/performance-combat/) check.

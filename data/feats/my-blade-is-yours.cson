benefit: '''
  When adjacent to an ally with this feat who is wielding a weapon with the blockingUE, disarm, distracting, or trip weapon special feature, you can treat your own weapon as if it also had that feature. If your ally's weapon has more than one of those features, you choose one feature to emulate at the start of your turn.

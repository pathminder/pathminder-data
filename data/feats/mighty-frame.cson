benefit: '''
  You gain the powerful build special quality, which lets you function in many ways as if you were one size category larger.
  
  Whenever you are subject to a size modifier or special size modifier for a Combat Maneuver Bonus or Combat Maneuver Defense (such as during grapple checks, bull rush attempts, and trip attempts), you are treated as one size larger if doing so is advantageous to you.
  
  You are also considered to be one size larger when determining whether a creature's special attacks based on size (such as grab or swallow whole) can affect you.
  
  You may use weapons designed for a creature one size larger without penalty. However, your space and reach remain those of a creature your actual size. The benefits of this ability stack with the effects of abilities, powers, and spells that change the subject's size category.

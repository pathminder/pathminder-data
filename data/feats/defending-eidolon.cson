benefit: '''
  Whenever you are adjacent to your eidolon, you can choose for the eidolon to take a --1 penalty on melee attack rolls and combat maneuver checks to gain a +1 dodge bonus to your Armor Class. When your eidolon's base attack bonus reaches +5, and for every +5 thereafter, the penalty increases by --1 and the dodge bonus increases by +1. You must choose to use this feat when your eidolon is making an attack or full-attack action with melee or natural weapons, and its effect lasts until your eidolon's next turn, or until you are no longer adjacent to the eidolon, whichever occurs first.

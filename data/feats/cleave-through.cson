benefit: '''
  When using [Cleave](/feats/cleave/) or [Great Cleave](/feats/great-cleave/), if your initial attack hits, you may take a single 5-foot step as a free action before making your additional attacks. If doing so places a creature within your threatened area, that creature becomes a legal target for your additional Cleave attack(s) as long as it meets all the other prerequisites.
'''
normal: '''
  You may only make additional attacks with [Cleave](/feats/cleave/) against creatures you threaten when you make your initial attack.

benefit: '''
  When you make a sneak attack with a poisoned weapon, you can forgo some of your sneak attack damage to increase the save DC of your poison, increasing the poison's save DC by 1 for every 1d6 points of sneak attack damage you forgo. This can't cause the save DC to exceed 15 + 1/2 your character level.

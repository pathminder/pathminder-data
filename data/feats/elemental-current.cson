prerequisites: [
  "Quick Draw"
  "two [Elemental Flux](/martial-disciplines/elemental-flux/) maneuvers known"
  "two [Mithral Current](/martial-disciplines/mithral-current/) maneuvers known"
]
benefit: "Whenever you use a [Mithral Current](/martial-disciplines/mithral-current/) strike or stance to make a creature vulnerable to silver, you can instead make that creature vulnerable to your active element's associated energy type. Creatures with vulnerability to an energy type half again as much (+50%) damage as normal from that energy type, as normal. If your target is normally immune to that energy type, they instead take half damage from that energy type instead of none for as long as they are vulnerable."

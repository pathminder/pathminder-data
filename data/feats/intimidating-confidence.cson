benefit: '''
  You gain a +1 bonus on saving throws against effects with the emotion descriptor; this bonus stacks with the bonus granted by [Fearless Curiosity](/feats/fearless-curiosity/). When you confirm a critical hit, as a free action you can make an [Intimidate](/skills/intimidate/) check to demoralize one creature you threaten. If you have the Dazzling Display feat, you can make [Intimidate](/skills/intimidate/) checks to demoralize all creatures you threaten instead. You gain a +2 bonus on this check if your weapon has a ×3 critical modifier, or +4 if it has a ×4 critical modifier.

summary: "Pin a target in place instead of a normal attack"
flavor_text: "You are capable of such exceptional aim that you can pin a foot to the ground, or a wing to a side."
prerequisites: [
  "Point-Blank Shot"
  "Precise Shot"
]
benefit: "Once per round, you can make a pinning shot in place of an attack action. When you do, make a ranged attack. If it hits, it deals no damage, but the target must succeed at a Reflex save (DC 10 + the damage your attack would have dealt) or stop in their tracks and become unable to move for one round. They can still take other actions as normal, but cannot leave their space. A flying creature that fails its saving throw falls, potentially taking falling damage, unless it succeeds at a Fly check with the same DC as the Reflex save."

flavor_text: "When you leap to the attack, your blows are like bolts from on high."
prerequisites: [
  "[Improved Unarmed Strike](/feats/improved-unarmed-strike/)"
  "[Janni Style](/feats/janni-style/)"

benefit: '''
  While using [Janni Style](/feats/janni-style/), you are always considered to have a running start when jumping. Further, if you jump as part of a charge and make an unarmed strike against the designated opponent, a hit allows you to roll the unarmed strike's damage dice twice and add the results together before adding modifiers (such as from Strength) or extra dice (such as precision-based damage or dice from weapon abilities). The extra damage dice are not multiplied on a successful critical hit.

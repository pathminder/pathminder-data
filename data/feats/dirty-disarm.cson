benefit: '''
  You can attempt to perform a dirty trick and a disarm maneuver together against a single target as a full-round action. You attempt a single combat maneuver check for both maneuvers. If your CMB is different for the two types of maneuvers, use the lower of the two bonuses. If your target's CMD is different against the two types of maneuvers, use the higher CMD. If you succeed at the check, you successfully perform both combat maneuvers.

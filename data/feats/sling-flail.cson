flavor_text: "You can use your loaded sling to effectively strike at nearby foes."
prerequisites: [
  "[Weapon Focus](/feats/weapon-focus/) (sling)"
  "base attack bonus +1"

benefit: '''
  You can make melee attacks using your loaded sling, using that weapon's normal statistics but treating it as a flail. Using a sling in this way does not expend mundane ammunition, but magical or masterwork ammunition loses its special properties after a single hit.
'''
special: '''
  Any feats you have that apply when you use a flail also apply when you use a loaded sling as a melee weapon.

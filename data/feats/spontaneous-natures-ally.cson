flavor_text: "Instead of casting a cure spell, you can instead cast *summon nature's ally*."
prerequisites: [
  "[Knowledge](/skills/knowledge/) (nature) 5 ranks"
  "ability to spontaneously cast *cure* spells or *inflict* spells"
  "Animal or Plant domain"
]
benefit: '''
  You can "lose" a prepared spell in order to cast any *summon nature's ally* spell of the same level or lower, instead of casting a *cure* spell or an *inflict* spell as you normally would. For the purpose of this feat only, the *summon nature's ally* spells of the appropriate spell levels count as being on your spell list at the same spell level as for a druid.

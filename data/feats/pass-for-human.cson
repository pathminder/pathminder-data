name: "Pass For Human"
sources: [
  "Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Advanced Player's Guide"

flavor_text: "You're easily mistaken for a human rather than a member of your own race."
prerequisites: [
  "half-elf, half-orc, or halfling (see Special)"
]
benefit: '''
  You receive a +10 bonus on [Disguise](/skills/disguise/) checks to disguise yourself as a human, and do not receive the penalty for disguising yourself as a member of another race when you do so. In areas largely populated or settled by humans, you can take 10 on your [Disguise](/skills/disguise/) check, meaning most people tend to assume you are human unless given a reason to think otherwise.
'''
special: '''
  A halfling may take this feat, but must have the [Childlike](/feats/childlike/) feat as a prerequisite. The benefits of the two feats stack.

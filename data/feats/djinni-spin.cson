benefit: '''
  While using [Djinni Style](/feats/djinni-style/), as a standard action you can spend two [Elemental Fist](/feats/elemental-fist/) attempts to surround yourself with a whirlwind of electrified air. Creatures adjacent to you take your unarmed strike damage plus the electricity damage from your [Elemental Fist](/feats/elemental-fist/) and are deafened for 1d4 rounds. A successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier) reduces the damage by half and prevents a target from being deafened.

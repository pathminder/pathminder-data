benefit: "Once per round, when you hit with an attack, you can expend a readied maneuver as a free action to forcibly teleport your target. That creature must succeed at a Will save (DC 10 + the expended maneuver's level + your highest initiation modifier) or be teleported to any unoccupied space within 30 feet of them that you can see. You need not teleport them to a location that can support them; you can teleport them into the air, into difficult terrain, or into dangerous situations as you see fit. This is a supernatural ability, and is considered a Veiled Moon maneuver for the purposes of save DCs and abilities such as the Discipline Focus feat."

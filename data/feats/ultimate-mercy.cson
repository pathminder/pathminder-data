benefit: '''
  You can expend 10 uses of lay on hands to bring a single dead creature you touch back to life as a [*raise dead*](/spells/raise-dead/) spell with a caster level equal to your paladin level. You must provide the material component for [*raise dead*](/spells/raise-dead/) or choose to accept 1 temporary negative level; this level automatically goes away after 24 hours, never becomes a permanent negative level, and cannot be overcome in any way except by waiting for the duration to expire.

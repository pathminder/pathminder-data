text: '''
  This spell functions as [*teleport*](/spells/teleport/), except there is truly no range limit and you do not need to have seen your destination, though you must have a solid grasp of which world you [*wish*](/spells/wish/) to travel to ("the third planet from the sun" is an acceptable destination, but "a habitable world near that bright star" is not). If you have a specific location on a planet in mind, you arrive there without a chance of failure; otherwise you arrive at a location that would not immediately be life-threatening. If no such safe landing zone exists on the world, such as someone attempting to travel into the sun without the proper precautions in place, the spell simply fails.

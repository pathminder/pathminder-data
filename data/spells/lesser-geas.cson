text: '''
  A *lesser geas* places a magical command on a creature to carry out some service or to refrain from some action or course of activity, as desired by you. The creature must have 7 or fewer HD and be able to understand you. While a geas cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts that would result in certain death, it can cause almost any other course of activity.
  The geased creature must follow the given instructions until the geas is completed, no matter how long it takes.
  
  If the instructions involve some open-ended task that the recipient cannot complete through his own actions, the spell remains in effect for a maximum of 1 day per caster level. A clever recipient can subvert some instructions.
  
  If the subject is prevented from obeying the *lesser geas* for 24 hours, it takes a --2 penalty to each of its ability scores. Each day, another --2 penalty accumulates, up to a total of --8. No ability score can be reduced to less than 1 by this effect. The ability score penalties are removed 24 hours after the subject resumes obeying the *lesser geas*.
  
  A *lesser geas* (and all ability score penalties) can be ended by [*break enchantment*](/spells/break-enchantment/), [*limited [*wish*](/spells/wish/)*](/spells/limited-wish/), [*remove curse*](/spells/remove-curse/), [*miracle*](/spells/miracle/), or [*wish*](/spells/wish/). [*Dispel magic*](/spells/dispel-magic/) does not affect a lesser geas.

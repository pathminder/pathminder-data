text: '''
  This spell functions as [*entangle*](/spells/entangle/), except the plants are coated with an irritating sap that creates a painful, itching rash on creatures that touch them. Any creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must succeed at a Fortitude save or be sickened for as long as it remains in the area and for 1d4 rounds afterward. This is a poison effect.

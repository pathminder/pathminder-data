  This spell functions as [*whip of spiders*](/spells/whip-of-spiders/), except it summons centipedes, and any creature you strike with the whip takes swarm damage as if it were attacked by a centipede swarm (2d6 points of damage plus poison and distraction). If you transform the whip into a centipede swarm, it has 10 hit points.

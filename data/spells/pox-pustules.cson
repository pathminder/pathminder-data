text: '''
  You inflict a painful, itching rash on the target creature. The target is sickened and takes a --4 penalty to Dexterity (this penalty cannot lower Dexterity below 0). The target can spend a move action scratching furiously at the rash to remove the sickened condition (but not the Dexterity penalty) until the start of its next turn.

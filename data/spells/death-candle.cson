text: '''
  This spell functions like [*death knell*](/spells/death-knell/), except instead of using the slain target's life energy to enhance yourself, you use it to summon a Small fire elemental resembling a burning, howling version of the slain creature. The elemental acts immediately on your turn and otherwise behaves as if you had summoned it with [*summon monster II*](/spells/summon-monster-ii/). The elemental remains for a number of rounds equal to the Hit Dice of the slain creature.

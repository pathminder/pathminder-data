text: '''
  You take on an aspect of a falcon. Your eyes become wide and raptor-like, and you grow feathers on the sides of your head. You gain a +3 competence bonus on [Perception](/skills/perception/) checks, a +1 competence bonus on ranged attacks, and the critical multiplier for your bows and crossbows becomes 19--20/Ã—3. This effect does not stack with any other effect that expands the threat range of a weapon, such as the Improved Critical feat or a keen weapon.

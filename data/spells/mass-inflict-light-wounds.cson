text: '''
  Negative energy spreads out in all directions from the point of origin, dealing 1d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +25) to nearby living enemies.
  
  Like other inflict spells, *mass inflict light wounds* cures undead in its area rather than damaging them. A cleric capable of spontaneously casting *inflict* spells can also spontaneously cast *mass inflict* spells.

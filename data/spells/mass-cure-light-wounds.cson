text: '''
  You channel positive energy to cure 1d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +25) on each selected creature. Like other *cure* spells, *mass cure light wounds* deals damage to undead in its area rather than curing them. Each affected undead may attempt a Will save for half damage.

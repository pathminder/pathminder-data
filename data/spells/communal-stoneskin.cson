text: '''
  This spell functions like [*stoneskin*](/spells/stoneskin/), except you divide the duration in 10 minute intervals among the creatures touched. Once the spell has prevented 10 points of damage per caster level (maximum 150 points) for a subject, the spell's effects end for that subject.

text: '''
  Driving sleet blocks all sight (even darkvision) within it and causes the ground in the area to be icy. A creature can walk within or through the area of sleet at half normal speed with a DC 10 [Acrobatics](/skills/acrobatics/) check. Failure means it can't move in that round, while failure by 5 or more means it falls (see the [Acrobatics](/skills/acrobatics/) skill for details).
  The sleet extinguishes torches and small fires.

text: '''
  A pale glow surrounds and outlines the subjects. Outlined subjects shed light as candles. Creatures outlined by *faerie fire* take a --20 penalty on all [Stealth](/skills/stealth/) checks. Outlined creatures do not benefit from the concealment normally provided by [*darkness*](/spells/darkness/) (though a 2nd-level or higher magical darkness effect functions normally), [*blur*](/spells/blur/), [*displacement*](/spells/displacement/), [*invisibility*](/spells/invisibility/), or similar effects. The light is too dim to have any special effect on undead or dark-dwelling creatures vulnerable to light. The *faerie fire* can be blue, green, or violet, according to your choice at the time of casting. The faerie fire does not cause any harm to the objects or creatures thus outlined.

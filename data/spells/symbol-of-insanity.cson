text: '''
  This spell functions like [*symbol of death*](/spells/symbol-of-death/), except that all creatures within the radius of the *symbol of insanity* instead become permanently insane (as the [*insanity*](/spells/insanity/) spell).
  
  Unlike *symbol of death*, *symbol of insanity* has no hit point limit; once triggered, a *symbol of insanity* simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.
  
  *Note:* Magic traps such as *symbol of insanity* are hard to detect and disable. While any character can use [Perception](/skills/perception/) to find a symbol, only a character with the trapfinding class feature can use [Disable Device](/skills/disable-device/) to disarm it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 33 for *symbol of insanity*.

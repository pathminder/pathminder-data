text: '''
  This spell functions like [*brand*](/spells/brand/), except that it inflicts 1d6 points of damage when applied and cannot be removed, even temporarily. In addition, a *greater brand* blazes as bright as a torch when brought within 30 feet of a visible symbol of your faith. While the symbol is blazing, the recipient is sickened. Like the effects of [*bestow curse*](/spells/bestow-curse/), a *greater brand* cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by any means that removes a [*mark of justice*](/spells/mark-of-justice/).

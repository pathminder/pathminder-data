text: '''
  This spell functions like [*shadow evocation*](/spells/shadow-evocation/), except that it enables you to create partially real, illusory versions of sorcerer or wizard evocation spells of 7th level or lower. If recognized as a *greater shadow evocation*, a spell only has three-fifths (60%) the normal affect (if applicable) or is only 60% likely to occur.

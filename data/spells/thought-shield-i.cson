  Sensing an intrusion, you throw up a defense to protect your mind from attack or analysis. This grants you a +4 circumstance bonus on Will saving throws against mind-affecting effects. As long as this spell lasts, spells and effects that allow a creature to read your thoughts receive no information from you.

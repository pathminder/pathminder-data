text: '''
  You mark the target with a black marking on its skin; the mark's exact appearance is determined by you, but can be no larger than your hand. The black mark functions as a mark of justice, and when the mark is activated, the target becomes shaken anytime it is on or in the water more than a 5 feet from shore. In addition, as long as the black mark is active, the target is affected as if subject to [*nature's exile*](/spells/natures-exile/), but all creatures with the aquatic or water subtype or with a swim speed are made hostile, even those not of the animal type, though non-aquatic animals are not.

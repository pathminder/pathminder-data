text: '''
  This spell functions as [*bestow curse*](/spells/bestow-curse/), except that you must state a condition under which the curse is broken, ending its effect. An intelligent target, even one of animal intelligence, innately understands this condition even if it doesn't understand your language. The condition must be possible for the target to bring about within a year and a day without ensuring its own death and stated in 25 or fewer words. The curse is more difficult to remove via magic. The DC to remove *conditional curse* with [*break enchantment*](/spells/break-enchantment/) or [*remove curse*](/spells/remove-curse/) increases by 5.

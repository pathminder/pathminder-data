text: '''
  *Magic fang* gives one natural weapon or unarmed strike of the subject a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls. The spell can affect a slam attack, fist, bite, or other natural weapon. The spell does not change an unarmed strike's damage from nonlethal damage to lethal damage.
  
  *Magic fang* can be made permanent with a [*permanency*](/spells/permanency/) spell.

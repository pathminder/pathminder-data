text: "A brushy beard of stiff iron erupts from the subject's face. The *ironbeard* grants a +1 armor bonus to AC, which stacks with any armor worn by the creature. The *ironbeard* can also be used as a weapon equivalent to cold iron armor spikes. The *ironbeard* makes it difficult to speak, so any spellcasting with a verbal component has a 20% spell failure chance."

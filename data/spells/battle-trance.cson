  You are transformed into a single-minded force of destruction. You gain the ferocity monster special ability, a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d6 + your caster level (maximum +10), and a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects. You cannot use the withdraw action or willingly move away from a creature that has attacked you.
  
  When you use this spell, you immediately take 4 points of Intelligence damage. You must make a DC 20 concentration check to cast spells, and all other concentration checks to cast spells have a --5 penalty.

text: '''
  This spell functions as [*disguise self*](/spells/disguise-self/), except as a swift action you can alter the [Disguise](/skills/disguise/) (within the limitations of *disguise self*). For example, you could make yourself look like a young human city guard, then an old elven wizard of the opposite gender, then a halfing thief, and so on. You can change the [Disguise](/skills/disguise/) a number of times equal to your caster level.

text: '''
  This litany causes your enemy to feel the pain of blows more sharply. Anyone who hits the target with an attack gains a +5 sacred or profane bonus (depending on the alignment of the caster) to that attack's damage.
  
  While subject to this spell, the target cannot be the target of another spell that has the word "litany" in the title.

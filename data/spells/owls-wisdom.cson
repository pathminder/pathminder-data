text: '''
  The transmuted creature becomes wiser. The spell grants a +4 enhancement bonus to Wisdom, adding the usual benefit to Wisdom-related skills. Clerics, druids, and rangers (and other Wisdom-based spellcasters) who receive *owl's wisdom* do not gain any additional bonus spells for the increased Wisdom, but the save DCs for their spells increase.

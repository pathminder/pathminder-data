text: '''
  You cast your consciousness into a single object within range that bears your likeness, as if choosing a specific image with the spell [*enter image*](/spells/enter-image/). In addition to observing your surroundings, speaking, and manipulating the image you inhabit, however, you can converse with nearby creatures and use your normal social skills.
  
  You gain a +5 bonus on Bluff checks to tell lies and Diplomacy checks to make a request. You gain a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks and use the object's size to determine whether you gain a bonus or penalty on Intimidate checks for size.

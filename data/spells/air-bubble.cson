text: '''
  *Air bubble* creates a small pocket of breathable air that surrounds the touched creature's head or the touched
  object. The *air bubble* allows the creature touched to breathe underwater or in similar airless environments, or protects the object touched from water damage.
  
  A firearm within an *air bubble* can be loaded---assuming the black powder comes from a powder horn, a cartridge, or some other airtight protective device---and fired. When shooting such a firearm underwater, the shot still takes the standard --2 penalty on attack rolls for every 5 feet of water the bullet passes through, in addition to normal penalties due to range. If a firearm within the *air bubble* explodes, the explosion occurs normally.

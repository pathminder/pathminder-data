text: '''
  You surround yourself with a mantle of calm serenity. You take a --2 penalty on attack rolls, and opponents gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells you cast. Any creature affected by a rage effect (barbarian's rage, bloodrager's bloodrage, blood rage monster ability, [*rage*](/spells/rage/) spell, skald's inspired rage raging song, and so on) that strikes you with a melee attack must attempt a Will saving throw, without the rage effect's bonus to Will; failure means the rage effect ends (as if it were dispelled or the creature voluntarily ended it, as appropriate).
  
  If you become affected by a rage effect while this spell is active, this spell immediately ends. If your rage effect comes from a skald's raging song, then it ends only for you, and you cannot regain the effects of the song.

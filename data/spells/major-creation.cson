  This spell functions like [*minor creation*](/spells/minor-creation/), except that you can also create an object of mineral nature: stone, crystal, metal, or the like. The duration of the created item varies with its relative hardness and rarity, as indicated on the following table.
  
  Hardness and Rarity Examples | Duration
  :--|:--:
  Vegetable matter | 2 hr./level
  Stone, crystal, base metals | 1 hr./level
  Precious metals | 20 min./level
  Gems | 10 min./level
  Rare metal (includes adamantine, alchemical silver, and mithral) | 1 round/level
  
  You can't use major creation to create a cold iron item.

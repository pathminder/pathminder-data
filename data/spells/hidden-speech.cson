  You greatly enhance the ability of the subjects to communicate hidden messages to each other. Each target gains a +10 competence bonus on [Bluff](/skills/bluff/) checks to send secret message to other recipients. Others using opposed [Sense Motive](/skills/sense-motive/) checks to decipher these messages receive a --5 penalty. All subjects affected by the spell must share a language to be able to pass messages.

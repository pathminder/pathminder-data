text: '''
  You cause the subject to believe it is being attacked by a creature out of its nightmares. Each round, the subject makes a full-attack action against the creature. A flying creature can still attempt a Fly check to hover. Each round on its turn after making a full attack against the imaginary creature, the subject can attempt a new saving throw to end the effect. The subject is fatigued for 1 minute after the spell ends.

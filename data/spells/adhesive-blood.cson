text: '''
  Your blood thickens to becomes a glue-like substance upon contact with air. A piercing or slashing weapon that deals hit point damage to you is stuck fast unless the wielder succeeds at a Reflex save. A creature can pry off a stuck weapon on its turn as a standard action with a successful Strength check against the spell's DC. Strong alcohol or universal solvent dissolves the adhesive. The glue breaks down 5 rounds after you die, or when the duration ends. This glue has no effect while underwater or in environments that lack air.

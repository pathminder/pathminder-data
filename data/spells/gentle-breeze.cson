  You create a light wind that blows only against the target, from a direction of your choice. The breeze grants the target a +2 circumstance bonus on saves against very hot conditions, severe heat, and saves against clouds, vapors, and gases (such as [*cloudkill*](/spells/cloudkill/), [*stinking cloud*](/spells/stinking-cloud], and inhaled poisons). There must be air present to use this spell.

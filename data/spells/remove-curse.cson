text: '''
  *Remove curse* can remove all curses on an object or a creature. If the target is a creature, you must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against the DC of each curse affecting the target. Success means that the curse is removed. *Remove curse* does not remove the curse from a cursed shield, weapon, or suit of armor, although a successful caster level check enables the creature afflicted with any such cursed item to remove and get rid of it. *Remove curse* counters and dispels [*bestow curse*](/spells/bestow-curse/).

text: '''
  You override the target's ability to feel pain. Pain effects (such as [*pain strike*](/spells/pain-strike/) and [*symbol of pain*](/spells/symbol-of-pain/)) do not affect the target until this spell's duration has expired. This does not negate any physical damage, ability damage, or ability drain that a pain effect has already done, but it does negate ongoing penalties from pain while the spell lasts.

text: '''
  An invisible but tangible field of force surrounds the subject of a mage armor spell, providing a +4 armor bonus to AC.
  
  Unlike mundane armor, *mage armor* entails no armor check penalty, arcane spell failure chance, or speed reduction. Since *mage armor* is made of force, incorporeal creatures can't bypass it the way they do normal armor.

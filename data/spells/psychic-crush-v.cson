text: '''
  This functions as [*psychic crush IV*](/spells/psychic-crush-iv/), but on a successful Fortitude or Will save, the target takes 11d6 points of damage + 1 point of damage per caster level. If it is at fewer than half its total hit points, the target takes a â€“2 penalty on the Will save to resist this spell. This spell can be undercast.

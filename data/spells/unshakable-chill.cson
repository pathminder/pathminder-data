text: '''
  The target is filled with an unshakable chill for the duration of the spell, and suffers from the effects of severe cold. Severe cold means if the initial saving throw fails, the target takes 1d6 points of nonlethal cold damage and must save every 10 minutes (using the DC of severe cold instead of this spell's DC) or take additional damage.

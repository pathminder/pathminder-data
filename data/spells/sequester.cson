text: '''
  When cast, this spell prevents divination spells from detecting or locating the target and also renders the affected target invisible (as the [*invisibility*](/spells/invisibility/) spell). The spell does not prevent the subject from being discovered through tactile means or through the use of devices. Creatures affected by *sequester* become comatose and are effectively in a state of suspended animation until the spell ends.
  
  *Note:* The Will save prevents an attended or magical object from being sequestered. There is no save to see the sequestered creature or object or to detect it with a divination spell.

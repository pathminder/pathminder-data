text: '''
  This spell functions as [*mental barrier I*](/spells/mental-barrier-i/), but the shield bonus to AC increases to +6. In addition, you take half damage from [*mind thrust I*](/spells/mind-thrust-i/), [*II*](/spells/mind-thrust-ii/), and [*III*](/spells/mind-thrust-iii/) (reduced to one-quarter on a successful Will save). This spell can be undercast.

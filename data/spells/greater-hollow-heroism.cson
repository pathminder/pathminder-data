text: '''
  This spell functions as [*greater heroism*](/spells/greater/heroism/), except that you can reverse the spell by issuing a special command as a standard action if you are within medium range of the target. The target loses the bonuses and instead takes a --4 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, and 4 skill checks until the spell's duration ends (no save), increasing to a --8 penalty against fear effects. Additionally, she takes damage equal to your caster level when you reverse the spell.
  
  Attempts to identify greater hollow heroism with a skill check incorrectly identify it as [*greater heroism*](/spells/greater-heroism/), as per the [ruse](/descriptors/ruse) descriptor.

  This spell functions like [*arcane sight*](/spells/arcane-sight/), except that you automatically know which spells or magical effects are active upon any individual or object you see.
  
  Unlike *arcane sight*, this spell cannot be made permanent with a [*permanency*](/spells/permanency/) spell.

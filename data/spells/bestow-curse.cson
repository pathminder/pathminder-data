  - --6 decrease to an ability score (minimum 1).
  - --4 penalty on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks.
  - Each turn, the target has a 50% chance to act normally; otherwise, it takes no action.
  - The target is afflicted with a minor [spellblight](/systems/spellblights/).
  
  You may also invent your own curse, but it should be no more powerful than those described above.

text: '''
  This spell frees victims from enchantments, transmutations, and curses. *Break enchantment* can reverse even an instantaneous effect. For each such effect, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level, maximum +15) against a DC of 11 + caster level of the effect. Success means that the creature is free of the spell, curse, or effect. For a cursed magic item, the DC is equal to the DC of the curse.
  
  If the spell is one that cannot be dispelled by [*dispel magic*](/spells/dispel-magic/) or [*stone to flesh*](/spells/stone-to-flesh/), *break enchantment* works only if that spell is 5th level or lower.
  
  If the effect comes from a permanent magic item, *break enchantment* does not remove the curse from the item, but it does free the victim from the item's effects.

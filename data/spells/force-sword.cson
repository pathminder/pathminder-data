text: '''
  You create a *+1 longsword* of pure force sized appropriately for you that you can wield or give to another creature like any other longsword. At 8th level, the sword functions as a *+2 longsword*. At 13th level, it functions as a *+3 longsword*. A *force sword* cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but *dispel magic*, *disintegrate*, a *sphere of annihilation*, or a *rod of cancellation* affects it.
  
  If a creature you attack with the *sword* has spell resistance, you must attempt a caster level check (1d20 + your caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the *force sword* strikes it. If you fail the check, the spell is dispelled. If you succeed, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.

text: '''
  This spell functions like [*symbol of death*](/spells/symbol-of-death/), except that each creature within the radius of a *symbol of pain* instead suffers wracking pains that impose a --4 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks. These effects last for 1 hour after the creature moves farther than 60 feet from the symbol.
  
  Unlike *symbol of death*, *symbol of pain* has no hit point limit; once
  triggered, a symbol of pain simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.
  
  *Note:* Magic traps such as *symbol of pain* are hard to detect and disable. While any character can use [Perception](/skills/perception/) to find a symbol, only a character with the trapfinding class feature can use [Disable Device](/skills/disable-device/) to disarm it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 30 for *symbol of pain*.

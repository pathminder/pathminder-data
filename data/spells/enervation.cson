text: '''
  You point your finger and fire a black ray of negative energy that suppresses the life force of any living creature it strikes. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit. If you hit, the subject gains 1d4 temporary negative levels. Negative levels stack.
  
  Assuming the subject survives, it regains lost levels after a number of hours equal to your caster level (maximum 15 hours). Usually, negative levels have a chance of becoming permanent, but the negative levels from *enervation* don't last long enough to do so.
  
  An undead creature struck by the ray gains 1d4 Ã— 5 temporary hit points for 1 hour.

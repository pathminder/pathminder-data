effect: "one or two called fey, totaling no more than 12 Hit Dice, which can't appear more than 30 ft. apart"
text: '''
  This spell functions as [*lesser entice fey*](/spells/lesser-entice-fey/), except that the spell's whimsical calling can produce a single fey of 12 Hit Dice or less, or two fey of the same kind whose Hit Dice total no more than 12.

text: '''
  This spell functions as [*mental barrier I*](/spells/mental-barrier-i/), but the shield bonus to AC increases to +8. In addition, you are immune to [*mind thrust I*](/spells/mind-thrust-i/), and you take half damage from [*mind thrust II*](/spells/mind-thrust-ii/), [*III*](/spells/mind-thrust-iii/), and [*IV*](/spells/mind-thrust-iv/) (reduced to one-quarter on a successful Will save). This spell can be undercast.

text: '''
  This spell functions like [*lesser restoration*](/spells/lesser-restoration/), except that it dispels all permanent and temporary negative levels afflicting the healed creature. *Greater restoration* also dispels all magical effects penalizing the creature's abilities, cures all temporary ability damage, and restores all points permanently drained from all ability scores. It also eliminates fatigue and exhaustion, and removes all forms of insanity, confusion, and similar mental effects.

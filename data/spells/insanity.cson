text: '''
  The affected creature suffers from a continuous confusion effect, as the spell.
  Remove curse does not remove insanity. Greater restoration, heal, [*limited [*wish*](/spells/wish/)*](/spells/limited-wish/), [*miracle*](/spells/miracle/), or [*wish*](/spells/wish/) can restore the creature.

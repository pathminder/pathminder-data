text: '''
  The subject of this spell appears to be about 2 feet away from its true location. The creature benefits from a 50% miss chance as if it had total concealment. Unlike actual total concealment, *displacement* does not prevent enemies from targeting the creature normally. [*True seeing*](/spells/true-seeing/) reveals its true location and negates the miss chance.

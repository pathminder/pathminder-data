text: '''
  This spell functions as [*mirror hideaway*](/spells/mirror-hideaway/), except any creature that enters the target mirror can spend a swift action to exit through another mirror within 500 feet as if using [*dimension door*](/spells/dimension-door/); this is a one-way transport. The creature can exit through a mirror only if it could fit through an opening the same size as the mirror. Each transport through the target mirror reduces the spell's duration by 1 hour.

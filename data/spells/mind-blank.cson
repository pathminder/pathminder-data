text: '''
  The subject is protected from all devices and spells that gather information about the target through divination magic (such as [*detect evil*](/spells/detect-evil/), [*locate creature*](/spells/locate-creature/), [*scry*](/spells/scry/), and [*see invisible*](/spells/see-invisible/)). This spell also grants a +8 resistance bonus on saving throws against all mind-affecting spells and effects. Mind blank even foils [*limited [*wish*](/spells/wish/)*](/spells/limited-wish/), [*miracle*](/spells/miracle/), and [*wish*](/spells/wish/) spells when they are used in such a way as to gain information about the target. In the case of scrying that scans an area the creature is in, such as [*arcane eye*](/spells/arcane-eye/), the spell works but the creature simply isn't detected. Scrying attempts that are targeted specifically at the subject do not work at all.

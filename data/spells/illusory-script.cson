text: '''
  You write instructions or other information on parchment, paper, or any suitable writing material. The *illusory script* appears to be some form of foreign or magical writing. Only the person (or people) designated by you at the time of the casting can read the writing; it's unintelligible to any other character.
  
  Any unauthorized creature attempting to read the script triggers a potent illusory effect and must make a saving throw. A successful saving throw means the creature can look away with only a mild sense of disorientation. Failure means the creature is subject to a [*suggestion*](/spells/suggestion/) implanted in the script by you at the time the illusory script spell was cast. The *suggestion* lasts only 30 minutes. Typical *suggestions* include "Close the book and leave," "Forget the existence of this note," and so forth. If successfully dispelled by [*dispel magic*](/spells/dispel-magic/), the illusory script and its secret message disappear. The hidden message can be read by a combination of the [*true seeing*](/spells/true-seeing/) spell with the [*read magic*](/spells/read-magic/) or [*comprehend languages*](/spells/comprehend-languages/) spell.

text: '''
  This spell functions as [*alter self*](/spells/alter-self/), except you can as a swift action alter the [Disguise](/skills/disguise/) (within the limitations of *alter self*). For example, you could transform yourself into a halfing, then a lizardfolk, then an elf, and so on. You can change your form a number of times equal to your caster level.

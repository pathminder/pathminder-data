text: '''
  You polish a metal item until it is reflective enough to be used as a mirror. This spell does not prevent the item from later being affected by damage or corrosion that would ruin the mirrored surface. The spell can be cast only on a metal item with a fairly smooth and contiguous surface, such as a breastplate, a helm, a shield, or a sword, but not a mace, chainmail, or scale mail.

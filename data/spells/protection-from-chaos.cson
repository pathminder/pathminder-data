text: '''
  This spell functions like [*protection from evil*](/spells/protection-from-evil/), except that the deflection and resistance bonuses apply to attacks made by chaotic creatures. The target receives a new saving throw against control by chaotic creatures and chaotic summoned creatures cannot touch the target.

text: '''
  You alter the target's voice to something else. For example, you could make the target's voice high-pitched, husky, or nasal, or change its accent to an accent you are familiar with. If this spell is used as part of a disguise, the target gets a +10 bonus on the [Disguise](/skills/disguise/) check when trying to fool a listener.
  
  The target can vary the disguised voice just as it could its normal voice. For example, a halfing female given a male dwarf noble's voice and accent could speak in falsetto, with a rural halfing accent, and so on.

text: '''
  This spell functions like [*lesser planar binding*](/spells/lesser-planar-binding/), except that you may call a single creature of 12 HD or less, or up to three creatures of the same kind whose Hit Dice total no more than 12. Each creature gets a saving throw, makes an independent attempt to escape, and must be individually persuaded to aid you.

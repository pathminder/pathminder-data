text: '''
  You levitate the target a few inches off the ground, removing solid footing and halving the target's speed. The target
  also takes a --4 penalty to CMD against bull rush, drag, and reposition attempts. A targeted creature that attacks with a melee or ranged weapon finds itself increasingly unstable; the first attack has a --1 penalty on attack rolls, the second --2, and so on, to a maximum penalty of --5. A full-round action spent stabilizing allows the creature to begin again at --1.
  
  This spell fails if cast on a flying creature.

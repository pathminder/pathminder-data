text: '''
  You create a nonmagical, unattended object of nonliving vegetable matter. The volume of the item created cannot exceed 1 cubic foot per caster level. You must succeed on an appropriate Craft skill check to make a complex item.
  
  Attempting to use any created object as a material component causes the spell to fail.

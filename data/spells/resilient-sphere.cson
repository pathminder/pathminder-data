text: '''
  A globe of shimmering force encloses a creature, provided the creature is small enough to fit within the diameter of the sphere. The sphere contains its subject for the spell's duration. The sphere functions as a [*wall of force*](/spells/wall-of-force/), except that it can be negated by [*dispel magic*](/spells/dispel-magic/). A subject inside the sphere can breathe normally. The sphere cannot be physically moved either by people outside it or by the struggles of those within.

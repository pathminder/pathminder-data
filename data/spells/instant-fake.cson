text: '''
  You create an illusory duplicate of the target item. If you hold the charge on this spell, you can deliver it while touching an object you steal with [Sleight of Hand](/skills/sleight-of-hand/) or a steal combat maneuver; in this case, the illusion phases into existence exactly as you remove the genuine article, allowing you to instantaneously replace a protected or guarded item with no change in appearance, weight, or other factors.
  
  The illusion appears to be a perfect replica. Actively examining the fake with an Appraise or Perception check grants a creature a Will save, but on a failed saving throw, it concludes that the fake is the genuine article. The illusion isn't a functional item, nor does it have any magical properties of the original. For example, an instant fake of a set of thieves' tools can't be used to pick a lock, a false warhammer can't harm a person or break an object, a suit of unreal chainmail offers no actual protection, and an illusory *potion of cure light wounds* doesn't heal any hit points when imbibed.

text: '''
  This spell functions as [*hex glyph*](/spells/hex-glyph/), except you can store a hex or a major hex (but not a grand hex). You trace the glyph with incense, which must first be sprinkled with powdered diamond (as noted in the
  components:
    - line).
  
  [*Read magic*](/spells/read-magic/) allows its caster to identify a *greater hex glyph* with a successful DC 16 [Spellcraft](/skills/spellcraft/) check.

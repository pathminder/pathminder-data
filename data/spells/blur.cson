text: '''
  The subject's outline appears blurred, shifting, and wavering. This distortion grants the subject concealment (20% miss chance).
  
  A [*see invisibility*](/spells/see-invisibility/) spell does not counteract the *blur* effect, but a [*true seeing*](/spells/true-seeing/) spell does.
  
  Opponents that cannot see the subject ignore the spell's effect (though fighting an unseen opponent carries penalties of its own).

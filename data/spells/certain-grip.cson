text: '''
  The subject's grip and footing become sure, granting a +4 competence bonus on Climb checks, on [Acrobatics](/skills/acrobatics/) checks to balance, and to CMD against bull rush, drag, reposition, and trip attempts. While affected by this spell, the target is also immune to the disarm combat maneuver.

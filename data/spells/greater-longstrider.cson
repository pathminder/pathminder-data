text: '''
  This spell functions as [*longstrider*](/spells/longstrider/), except it gives you a +20-foot enhancement bonus to your base speed and a +10-foot enhancement bonus to your other modes of movement (burrow, climb, fly, swim, and so on). It does not affect movement modes you do not actually have---for example, if you do not have a swim speed, this spell does not grant you a swim speed.

text: '''
  You conjure a Large, quasi-real, horselike creature (the exact coloration can be customized as you wish. It can be ridden only by you or by the one person for whom you specifically created the mount. A *phantom steed* has a black head and body, gray mane and tail, and smoke-colored, insubstantial hooves that make no sound. It has what seems to be a saddle, bit, and bridle. It does not  ght, but animals shun it and refuse to attack it.
  
  The mount is AC 18 (--1 size, +4 natural armor, +5 Dex) and 7 hit points + 1 hit point per caster level. If it loses all its hit points, the phantom steed disappears. A phantom steed has a speed of 20 feet per two caster levels, to a maximum of 100 feet at 10th level. It can bear its rider's weight plus up to 10 pounds per caster level.
  
  These mounts gain certain powers according to caster level. A mount's abilities include those of mounts of lower caster levels.
  
  *8th Level:* The mount can ride over sandy, muddy, or even swampy ground without difficulty or decrease in speed.
  
  *10th Level:* The mount can use [*water walk*](/spells/water-walk/) at will (as the spell, no action required to activate this ability).
  
  *12th Level:* The mount can use [*air walk*](/spells/air-walk/) at will (as the spell, no action required to activate this ability) for up to 1 round at a time, after which it falls to the ground.
  
  *14th Level:* The mount can fly at its speed with a bonus on [Fly](/skills/fly/) skill checks equal to your caster level.

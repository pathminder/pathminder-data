text: '''
  A black ray projects from your pointing finger. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target.
  
  The subject is immediately exhausted for the spell's duration. A successful Fortitude save means the creature is only fatigued.
  
  A character that is already fatigued instead becomes exhausted.
  
  This spell has no effect on a creature that is already exhausted. Unlike normal exhaustion or fatigue, the effect ends as soon as the spell's duration expires.

text: '''
  This spell functions as [*polymorph*](/spells/polymorph/) except that it allows the creature to take on the form of a dragon, magical beast, or plant creature. If you use this spell to cause the target to take on the form of an animal or magical beast, it functions as [*beast shape IV*](/spells/beast-shape-iv/). If the form is that of an elemental, the spell functions as [*elemental body III*](/spells/elemental-body-iii/). If the form is that of a humanoid, the spell functions as [*alter self*](/spells/alter-self/). If the form is that of a plant, the spell functions as [*plant shape II*](/spells/plant-shape-ii/). If the form is that of a dragon, the spell functions as [*form of the dragon I*](/spells/form-of-the-dragon-i/). The subject may choose to resume its normal form as a full-round action; doing so ends the spell.

  This spell allows you to inscribe your personal rune or mark, which can consist of no more than six characters. The writing can be visible or invisible. An *arcane mark* spell enables you to etch the rune upon any substance without harm to the material upon which it is placed. If an invisible mark is made, a [*detect magic*](/spells/detect-magic/) spell causes it to glow and be visible, though not necessarily understandable. [*See invisibility*](/spells/see-invisibility/), [*true seeing*](/spells/true-seeing/), a *gem of seeing*, or a *robe of eyes* likewise allows the user to see an invisible *arcane mark*. A [*read magic*](/spells/read-magic/) spell reveals the words, if any. The mark cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by the caster or by an [*erase*](/spells/erase/) spell.
  
  If an *arcane mark* is placed on a living being, the effect gradually fades in about a month.
  
  *Arcane mark* must be cast on an object prior to casting [*instant summons*](/spells/instant-summons/) on the same object (see that spell description for details).

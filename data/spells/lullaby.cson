  Any creature within the area that fails a Will save becomes drowsy and inattentive, taking a --5 penalty on [Perception](/skills/perception/) checks and a --2 penalty on Will saves against sleep effects while the lullaby is in effect. *Lullaby* lasts for as long as the caster concentrates, plus up to 1 round per caster level thereafter.

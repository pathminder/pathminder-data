text: '''
  This spell functions as [*false resurrection*](/spells/false-ressurection/) except that it calls a belier devil with the young simple template to possess the body and all parts of false resurrection that function like [*resurrection*](/spells/resurrection/) instead function like [*true resurrection*](/spells/true-resurrection/).
  
  Attempts to identify *greater false resurrection* with a skill check incorrectly identify it as [*true resurrection*](/spells/true-resurrection/), as per the [ruse](/descriptors/ruse) descriptor. A fooled viewer mistakes *greater false resurrection*'s aura as the lingering aura of an instantaneous conjuration effect.

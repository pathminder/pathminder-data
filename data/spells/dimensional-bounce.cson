text: '''
  You designate two locations within range and create a dimensional link between them; you must have line of effect to both locations when casting this spell. As a swift action, you can teleport from your current location to either of the designated locations as if you had cast [*dimension door*](/spells/dimension-door/). The spell is discharged once you have used it to teleport a number of times equal to one-fourth your caster level (maximum 5 times).

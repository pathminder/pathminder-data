text: '''
  Your litany is a fascinating diatribe of grace, causing your target to do nothing but listen. The target is fascinated. As usual, obvious danger prevents fascination and potential danger grants a save.
  
  While subject to this spell, the target cannot be the target of another spell that has the word "litany" in the title.

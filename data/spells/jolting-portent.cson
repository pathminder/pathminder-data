text: '''
  The creature you designate is surrounded by a glowing red aura of vengeful fate. Once per round when the target makes an attack or casts a spell, it must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw with a DC = 10 + 1/2 caster level + Charisma (in the case of oracles) or Wisdom (in the case of clerics). If the target fails the saving throw, it takes 4d6 + your Charisma modifier (in the case of oracles) or Wisdom modifier (in the case of clerics) electricity damage. It takes no damage on a successful saving throw. You can dismiss this spell as an immediate action when its subject confirms a critical hit to negate the critical hit and daze the creature for 1 round. The attack still hits its target and deals normal damage. The effects of the daze occur after the attack.

text: '''
  The warded creature or object becomes difficult to detect by divination spells such as [*clairaudience/clairvoyance*](/spells/clairaudience-clairvoyance/), [*locate object*](/spells/locate-object/), and *detect* spells. *Nondetection* also prevents location by such magic items as *crystal balls*. If a divination
  is attempted against the warded creature or item, the caster of the divination must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 11 + the caster level of the spellcaster who cast nondetection. If you cast *nondetection* on yourself or on an item currently in your possession, the DC is 15 + your caster level.
  
  If cast on a creature, *nondetection* wards the creature's gear as well as the creature itself.

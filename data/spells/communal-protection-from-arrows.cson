text: '''
  This spell functions like [*protection from arrows*](/spells/protection-from-arrows/), except you divide the duration in 1-hour intervals among the creatures touched. Once the spell absorbs 10 points of damage per caster level (maximum 100 points) for a subject, the spell's effects end for that subject.

text: '''
  You suppress sounds made by the targets, granting them a +4 bonus on [Stealth](/skills/stealth/) checks. The targets have a 20% chance of spell failure when casting spells with verbal
  components:
    - or using abilities that rely on audible
  components:
    - (such
  as some bardic performances). This spell does not hamper the targets' ability to hear other sounds and provides no protection against language-dependent or sonic spells and effects.

text: '''
  This spell functions like [*shadow enchantment*](/spells/shadow-enchantment/), except that it enables you to create partially real, illusory versions of psychic, sorcerer, or wizard enchantment spells of 5th level or lower. If the spell is recognized as a *greater shadow enchantment*, it's only three-fifths (60%) as effective.

text: '''
  This spell cures 5d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +25).
  Unlike other spells that heal damage, *breath of life* can bring recently slain creatures back to life. If cast upon a creature that has died within 1 round, apply the healing from this spell to the creature. If the healed creature's hit point total is at a negative amount less than its Constitution score, it comes back to life and stabilizes at its new hit point total. If the creature's hit point total is at a negative amount equal to or greater than its Constitution score, the creature remains dead. Creatures brought back to life through breath of life gain a temporary negative level that lasts for 1 day.
  
  Creatures slain by death effects cannot be saved by *breath of life*.
  
  Like *cure* spells, *breath of life* deals damage to undead creatures rather than curing them, and cannot bring them back to life.

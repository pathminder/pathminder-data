text: '''
  The body of the target creature gains a metabolic response that allows it to benefit from normally deadly toxins. When a poison would cause ability damage to the target creature, the target instead gains a +4 alchemical bonus to that ability score. The spell then immediately ends, but the bonus lasts for a number of minutes equal to the amount of ability damage the poison would have caused. If the poison would deal more than one type of ability damage, each bonus has a separate duration. If the poison has effects other than ability damage (such as unconsciousness or ability drain), these effects apply normally. This spell affects only a single poison; if multiple poisons affect the target simultaneously, this spell prevents only ability damage and grants the appropriate bonuses for the poison that would cause the most damage.

text: '''
  You focus emotional energy and weave it into a shroud of hardened ectoplasm around the weapon you touch, infusing it with a ghostly glow and great power. The weapon becomes a *ghost touch* weapon, and gains one of the following additional benefits, depending on the type of emotion you infuse into the weapon. If a special ability wouldn't apply to the chosen weapon (such as *vicious* on a ranged weapon), the weapon doesn't gain that benefit.
  
  *Anger:* The weapon also gains the *vicious* special ability.
  
  *Dedication:* The weapon also gains the *returning* special ability.
  
  *Despair:* The weapon also gains the *cruel* special ability.
  
  *Fear:* The weapon also gains the *menacing* special ability.
  
  *Hatred:* The weapon also gains the *cunning* special ability.
  
  *Jealousy:* The weapon also gains the *mimetic* special ability.
  
  *Zeal:* The weapon also gains the *keen* special ability.
  
  If you are a spiritualist and the type of emotional energy you choose matches the emotional focus of your phantom, the weapon grants its wielder a +2 bonus on skill checks with both skills you gain Skill Focus in from your phantom's emotional focus.

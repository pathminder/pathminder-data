text: '''
  As part of the action used to cast this spell, you place the mask used as its focus component on the target's face, after which it adheres tightly to the target for the spell's duration and cannot be removed by physical force. Despite lacking eyes, this mask does not impair its wearer's vision in any way. While in effect, this spell functions like *nondetection*, except it also foils divination spells that attempt to gather information about the creature, even if they don't target it. In the case of divination spells that would normally reveal the wearer's presence, such as *see invisibility*, the spell works but the wearer simply isn't detected if the caster fails its caster level check. Likewise, scrying attempts that are targeted specifically at the wearer do not work at all if the caster fails its caster level check. In addition, the DCs of all skill checks to learn about the wearer or identify the wearer and its strengths and weaknesses---including Diplomacy checks to gather information, Knowledge checks, and opposed Perception checks against the target's Disguise checks---increase by 4.
  
  The mask cannot be removed for the duration of the spell, and the fact that the target is wearing the focus mask cannot be hidden in any way from creatures that observe the target.

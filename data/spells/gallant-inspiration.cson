text: '''
  This word of arcane-empowered inspiration often ensures success of a crucial endeavor. Cast this spell when a creature fails an attack roll or skill check. The creature gains a +2d4 competence bonus to the attack roll or skill check retroactively. If the bonus is enough to turn the failure into a success, the roll succeeds.

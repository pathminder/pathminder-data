text: '''
  This spell functions like [*gaseous form*](/spells/gaseous-form/), except the target becomes a visible swirl of hot ash and smoke instead of harmless translucent gas. The target gains the fire subtype. Any creature that begins its turn sharing a space with the target takes 2d6 points of fire damage and must make a Fortitude save (DC 15, + 1 per previous check) or suffer the effects of smoke inhalation.

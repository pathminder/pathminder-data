  This functions as [*mental barrier III*](/spells/mental-barrier-iii/), but if you are struck by a critical hit or sneak attack, there is a 50% chance that the additional damage is negated (as *moderate fortification*). This does not stack with similar effects that negate the additional damage from a critical hit or sneak attack. In addition, you are immune to [*mind thrust I*](/spells/mind-thrust-i/), [*II*](/spells/mind-thrust-ii/), and [*III*](/spells/mind-thrust-iii/), and you take half damage from [*mind thrust IV*](/spells/mind-thrust-iv/), [*V*](/spells/mind-thrust-v/), and [*VI*](/spells/mind-thrust-vi/) (reduced to one-quarter on a successful Will save). This spell can be undercast.

text: '''
  You temporarily transfer one of your mythic path abilities to another creature, which can use it as if it were pa rt of the creature's own path. If the target is unable to expend mythic power, it can't activate any part of the ability that requires expending uses of mythic power, but the ability otherwise functions as if the creature were 1st tier.
  
  While your path ability is transferred in this way, you can't use it yourself (even if it's an automatic ability or one that doesn't requiReflexpending uses of mythic power).

text: '''
  This spell functions as the [*minor creation*](/spells/minor-creation/) spell, except the object created is a semi-real illusion. Any creature that interacts with the object may make a Will save, with success causing the object to cease to exist. A gnome casting this spell may make a [Spellcraft](/skills/spellcraft/) check in place of any [Craft](/skills/craft/) check required to make a complex item.

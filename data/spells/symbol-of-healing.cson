  This spell functions as [*symbol of death*](/spells/symbol-of-death/), except all creatures within 60 feet of the symbol of healing instead are bathed in positive energy and heal 2d8 points + 1 point of damage per caster level (maximum +15). Undead and other creatures harmed by positive energy instead take 2d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +15); a Will save reduces this damage by half. A creature can only be healed or harmed by the symbol once in any 24-hour period. Once triggered, the symbol remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.
  
  *Symbol of healing* can be made permanent with a [*permanency*](/spells/permanency/) spell by a caster of 10th level or higher for the cost of 10,000 gp.

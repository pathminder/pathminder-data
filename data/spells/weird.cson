text: '''
  target: any number of creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart
  This spell functions like [*phantasmal killer*](/spells/phantasmal-killer/), except it can affect more than one creature. Only the affected creatures see the phantasmal creatures attacking them, though you see the attackers as shadowy shapes.
  
  If a subject's Fortitude save succeeds, it still takes 3d6 points of damage and is stunned for 1 round. The subject also takes 1d4 points of Strength damage.

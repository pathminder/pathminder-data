text: '''
  When you cast *imprisonment* and touch a creature, it is entombed in a state of suspended animation (see the [*temporal stasis*](/spells/temporal-stasis/) spell) in a small sphere far beneath the surface of the ground. The subject remains there unless a [*freedom*](/spells/freedom/) spell is cast at the locale where the imprisonment took place. Magical search by a *crystal ball*, a [*locate object*](/spells/locate-object/) spell, or some other similar divination does not reveal the fact that a creature is imprisoned, but [*discern location*](/spells/discern-location/) does. A [*wish*](/spells/wish/) or [*miracle*](/spells/miracle/) spell will not free the recipient, but will reveal where it is entombed. If you know the target's name and some facts about its life, the target takes a --4 penalty on its save.

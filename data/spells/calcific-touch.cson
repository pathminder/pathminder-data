text: '''
  Your touch progressively transmutes the substance of creatures you touch into stone. Once per round, you may deliver a touch attack that inflicts 1d4 points of Dexterity damage and [*slows*](/spells/slow/) the target (as the spell) for 1 round. A successful Fortitude save negates the slow effect but not the ability damage. A target reduced to 0 Dexterity is petrified permanently. [*Break enchantment*](/spells/break-enchantment/), [*restoration*](/spells/restoration/), or [*stone to flesh*](/spells/stone-to-flesh/) can reverse the effects of *calcific touch*.

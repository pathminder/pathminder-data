text: '''
  This spell afflicts the subject with uncontrollable laughter. It collapses into gales of manic laughter, falling prone. The subject can take no actions while laughing, but is not considered helpless.
  
  On the creature's next turn, it may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect. If successful, the effect ends and the creature is treated as if it spent a full-round action on its turn.
  
  A creature with an Intelligence score of 2 or lower is not affected. A creature whose type is different from the caster's receives a +4 bonus on its saving throw, because humor doesn't "translate" well.

text: '''
  This spell functions as [*object possession*](/spells/object-possession/), except as noted above. The possessed animated object has a number of Construction Points appropriate for its size (up to 5 CP for Gargantuan objects). Your silver cord extends to medium range (100 ft. + 10 ft./level).
  
  You can attempt to possess a construct instead of an unattended object as your first possession with this spell. If you do, this spell acts as *control construct*, except as noted above.

  You give temporary physical form to a single musical note and can hang it, suspended, wherever you [*wish*](/spells/wish/) within range, allowing you to use it as a hook, pulley, door blocker, or anything else your imagination desires. The exact appearance of the *solid note* depends on your melody. You can make it spiked or smooth, simple or convoluted, and with any color pattern you [*wish*](/spells/wish/), however, it always has a size approximately equal to that of your outstretched hand. Once created, the *solid note* resists all attempts to move it but instantly disappears if enough force or weight is brought to bear against it. The note has an effective Strength equal to 10 + your caster level. It cannot hold more weight than the equivalent of a heavy load for its Strength without disappearing. Any creature that wins an opposed Strength check against the note (by pushing open a door which the note is holding shut for example) also causes it to disappear. The note can never deal actual harm to a creature and disappears if successfully attacked (AC 10 + your Charisma modifier) or overcome with a combat maneuver such as bull rush (CMD 2 + your base attack bonus + your Charisma modifier). Any creature obstructed by the solid note simply fails to budge it and loses that action for the round.

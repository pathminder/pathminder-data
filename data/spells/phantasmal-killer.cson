text: '''
  You create a phantasmal image of the most fearsome creature imaginable to the subject simply by forming the fears of the subject's subconscious mind into something that its conscious mind can visualize: this most horrible beast. Only the spell's subject can see the *phantasmal killer*. You see only a vague shape. The target first gets a Will save to recognize the image as unreal. If that save fails, the phantasm touches the subject, and the subject must succeed on a Fortitude save or die from fear. Even if the Fortitude save is successful, the subject takes 3d6 points of damage.
  
  If the subject of a *phantasmal killer* attack succeeds in disbelieving and possesses telepathy or is wearing a *helm of telepathy*, the beast can be turned upon you. You must then disbelieve it or become subject to its deadly fear attack.

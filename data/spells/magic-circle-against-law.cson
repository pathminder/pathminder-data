text: '''
  This spell functions like [*magic circle against evil*](/spells/magic-circle-against-evil/), except that it is similar to [*protection from law*](/spells/protection-from-law/) instead of [*protection from evil*](/spells/protection-from-evil/), and it can imprison a nonchaotic called creature.

text: '''
  This spell functions like [*eldritch conduit*](/spells/eldritch-conduit/) save for the differences listed above and that the target must be within medium range in order for you to use the conduit. Using a creature as a conduit for a spell ends the *greater eldritch conduit* effect on that creature, but does not end the effect for other eldritch conduits.

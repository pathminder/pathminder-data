text: '''
  The subject gains a +4 morale bonus on saves against all death spells and magical death effects. The subject is granted a save to negate such effects even if one is not normally allowed. The subject is immune to energy drain and any negative energy effects, including channeled negative energy.
  
  This spell does not remove negative levels that the subject has already gained, but it does remove the penalties from negative levels for the duration of its effect.
  
  *Death ward* does not protect against other sorts of attacks, even if those attacks might be lethal.

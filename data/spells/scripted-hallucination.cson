text: '''
  This spell functions as [*audiovisual hallucination*](/spells/audiovisual-hallucination/), except that the phantasm includes visual, auditory, olfactory, tactile, and thermal components, and the phantasm follows a complex script. The phantasm follows that script without your concentration and can react to stimuli the targets perceive.

text: '''
  This spell was created by the paladins of a fierce crusade, and co-opted by inquisitors and rangers dedicated to tracking and fighting demons, devils, and other evil extraplanar creatures.
  
  When you cast this spell on a melee weapon you imbue it with a powerful holy energy, granting the weapon the *bane* weapon quality against evil outsiders. Furthermore, whenever you score a successful critical hit against an outsider with the evil subtype, you not only deal normal critical damage with the weapon but also nauseate the outsider for 1d3 rounds---the outsider can reduce this nauseated condition to sickened for 1 round with a successful Fortitude save.

text: '''
  The affected targets become incredibly buoyant, floating naturally on any water at least 1 foot deep. An affected creature that deliberately tries to submerge must succeed at a DC 20 Swim check every round to stay underwater. If a target spends at least 1 round on dry land, the spell ends for that creature only.

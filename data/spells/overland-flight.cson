text: '''
  This spell functions like a [*fly*](/spells/fly/) spell, except you can fly at a speed of 40 feet (30 feet if wearing medium or heavy armor, or if carrying a medium or heavy load) with a bonus on [Fly](/skills/fly/) skill checks equal
  to half your caster level. When using this spell for long-distanceovement, you can hustle without taking nonlethal damage (a forced march still requires Constitution checks). This means you can cover 64 miles in an 8-hour period of flight (or 48 miles at a speed of 30 feet).

text: '''
  This functions as [*psychic crush I*](/spells/psychic-crush-i/), but on a successful Fortitude save, the target takes 5d6 points of damage + 1 point of damage per caster level. In addition, the target receives a +4 circumstance bonus on the Fortitude save only if it is at full hit points; otherwise, it gains a +2 bonus if it has more than half its total hit points remaining. This spell can be undercast.

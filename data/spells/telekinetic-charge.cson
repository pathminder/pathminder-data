text: '''
  You telekinetically launch an ally across the battlefield to anywhere within this spell's range. While moving, your ally is flying just above the ground unless you [*wish*](/spells/wish/) otherwise. Movement from this spell provokes attacks of opportunity as normal, although you can lift your ally over objects or out of enemy reach, as long as your ally remains within this spell's range. If your ally lands adjacent to an opponent, he can spend an immediate action to make a melee attack against that opponent with a +2 bonus on the attack roll.

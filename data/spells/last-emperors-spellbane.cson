  One of many spells originally created by the the Last Emperor before he became a god, *Last Emperor's spellbane* creates an area within which spells selected by you simply do not function. Select one spell per five caster levels at the time of casting. The spells selected cannot be changed after the spell is cast. *Last Emperor's spellbane* otherwise functions like [*antimagic field*](/spells/antimagic-field/), except its emanation only prevents the functioning of the selected spells. Only the exact spells mentioned are affected---a *spellbane* set to prevent the casting of [*summon nature's ally II*](/spells/summon-natures-ally-ii/) would not prevent castings of [*summon nature's ally I*](/spells/summon-natures-ally-i/) or [*summon nature's ally III*](/spells/summon-natures-ally-iii/). If you move into an area where a previously cast spell you have selected as a banned spell is in effect, that spell is affected as if by *antimagic field*. If the spell affects a summoned creature that has spell resistance, you must make a caster level check against the creature's spell resistance to make it wink out.
  
  *Last Emperor's spellbane* can even negate an *antimagic field*, another *Last Emperor's spellbane*, or any spell that specifies immunity to *antimagic field* (such as [*wall of force*](/spells/wall-of-force/), [*prismatic sphere*](/spells/prismatic-sphere/), and [*prismatic wall*](/spells/prismatic-wall/)). Multiple *spellbane* effects can overlap. Their effects stack, preventing the functioning of every spell targeted by any of the multiple *spellbane* emanations. Spell effects created by artifacts or deities cannot be suppressed by *Last Emperor's spellbane*.

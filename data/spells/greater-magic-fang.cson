text: '''
  This spell functions like [*magic fang*](/spells/magic-fang/), except that the enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls is +1 per four caster levels (maximum +5). This bonus does not allow a natural weapon or unarmed strike to bypass damage reduction aside from magic.
  
  Alternatively, you may imbue all of the creature's natural weapons with a +1 enhancement bonus (regardless of your caster level).
  
  *Greater magic fang* can be made permanent with a [*permanency*](/spells/permanency/) spell.

text: '''
  You cause the target to forget what happened from the casting of the spell back to the beginning of its last turn. This may allow a retry on a [Diplomacy](/skills/diplomacy/), [Intimidate](/skills/intimidate/), or opposed skill check, though only with respect to the target, not other creatures that may be present.

  This spell functions as [*mental barrier III*](/spells/mental-barrier-iii), but if you are struck by a critical hit or sneak attack, there is a 25% chance that the additional damage is negated (as light fortification). This does not stack with similar effects that negate the additional damage from a critical hit or sneak attack. In addition, you are immune to [*mind thrust I*](/spells/mind-thrust-i/) and [*II*](/spells/mind-thrust-ii/), and you take half damage from [*mind thrust III*](/spells/mind-thrust-iii/), [*IV*](/spells/mind-thrust-iv/), and [*V*](/spells/mind-thrust-v/) (reduced to one-quarter on a successful Will save). This spell can be undercast.

text: '''
  You imbue an object with psychic energy. The node of blasting unleashes a mental blast when a creature with a mind touches the object, dealing 6d6 points of damage to the creature touching the object and causing the creature to be staggered for 1 minute. A successful saving throw halves the damage and negates the staggered condition.
  
  Magic traps such as *node of blasting* are hard to detect and disable. A character with the trapfinding class feature can use Disable Device to thwart node of blasting. The DCs to find a node of blasting using Perception and to disable it using Disable Device are both equal to 25 + the spell's level. Additionally, a creature with the read aura occult skill unlock for [Perception](/skills/perception/) can attempt the same Perception check to notice a *node of blasting*.

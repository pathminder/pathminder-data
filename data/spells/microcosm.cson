text: '''
  You plunge the targets' minds into a veiled immersive mindscape of your own design. You can affect any number of creatures whose combined total Hit Dice do not exceed 30. A creature of 10 HD or fewer gets no saving throw, one of 11--15 HD escapes after 10 minutes per level you possess on a successful save, and a creature of 16 HD or more negates the effect on a successful save. Given time, the bodies of creatures whose minds are trapped in a *microcosm* can die of starvation and thirst without care. Creatures can neither escape from nor enter a microcosm, even via a [*mindscape door*](/spells/mindscape-door/). *Microcosm* can be ended only by *miracle* or *wish*.
  
  Creatures inside a *microcosm* can be affected by mind-affecting effects targeted against their real bodies. However, they perceive them as natural events within their inner mindscape. Multiple creatures affected by the same *microcosm* can interact with one another within the mindscape.

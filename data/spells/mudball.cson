text: '''
  When you cast this spell, you conjure a single ball of sticky mud and launch it at an enemy's face as a ranged touch attack. If the *mudball* hits, the target is blinded. Each round at the beginning of its turn, a creature blinded by this spell can attempt a Reflex saving throw to shake off the mud, ending the effect. The *mudball* can also be wiped off by the creature affected by it or by a creature adjacent to the creature affected by it as a standard action.

text: '''
  This spell functions as [*lesser object possession*](/spells/lesser-object-possession/), except as noted above. The possessed animated object has a number of Construction Points appropriate for its size (up to 3 CP for Large objects).
  
  You can return your consciousness to your body as a standard action. On your next turn, you can attempt to possess a different object as a standard action instead of ending the spell.

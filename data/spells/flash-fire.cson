  The firearm fires with a blinding flash, even if the firearm is not currently loaded. Every creature within 15 feet of the creature carrying the weapon must succeed at a Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds. The creature carrying the firearm takes a --4 penalty on this saving throw. If the firearm is loaded, the ammunition is wasted.

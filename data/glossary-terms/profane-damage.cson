  Profane damage comes from attacks that are heavily infused with the power of sheer Evil and carry this unholy power over as a form of harmful energy to good-aligned beings. Attacks that inflict profane damage inflict an additional 50% damage to good-aligned opponents or opponents with the Good subtype.

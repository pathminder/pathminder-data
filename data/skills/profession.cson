  You are skilled at a specific job. Like Craft, Knowledge, and Perform, Profession is actually a number of separate skills. You could have several Profession skills, each with its own ranks. While a Craft skill represents ability in creating an item, a Profession skill represents an aptitude in a vocation requiring a broader range of less specific knowledge. The most common Profession skills are architect, baker, barrister, brewer, butcher, clerk, cook, courtesan, driver, engineer, farmer, fisherman, gambler, gardener, herbalist, innkeeper, librarian, merchant, midwife, miller, miner, porter, sailor, scribe, shepherd, stable master, soldier, tanner, trapper, and woodcutter.
  
  Untrained laborers and assistants (that is, characters without any ranks in Profession) earn an average of 1 silver piece per day.

  ## Skill Unlocks
  
  If you have the [Signature Skill](/feats/signature-skill/) feat, the rogue's edge ability, or another ability that grants you the skill unlocks for this skill, you gain access to the following abilities when you have sufficient ranks. Each Profession skill gains access to skill unlocks separately.
  
  **5 Ranks:** When using Profession checks to earn income, you earn gold pieces equal to the result of your check each week.
  
  **10 Ranks:** When attempting Profession checks, you can roll twice and take the better result. When answering questions about your Profession, you can always take 10.
  
  **15 Ranks:** You can attempt checks to earn income once per day instead of once per week.
  
  **20 Ranks:** When attempting Profession checks, you can choose to roll once instead of twice. If you do and the result of the roll is less than 10, replace it with 10. When answering questions about your Profession, you can always take 20.

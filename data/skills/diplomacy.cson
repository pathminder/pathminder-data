  You can use this skill to persuade others to agree with your arguments, to resolve differences, and to gather valuable information or rumors from people. This skill is also used to negotiate conflicts by using the proper etiquette and manners suitable to the problem. Due to its ability to convince people without using either deception or coercion---and risking their negative consequences---the Diplomacy skill is one of the most commonly used forms of persuasion.
  
  You cannot use Diplomacy against a creature that does not understand you or has an Intelligence of 3 or less. Diplomacy is generally ineffective in combat and against creatures that intend to harm you or your allies in the immediate future.

  **Change Attitude:** With 1 minute of continuous interaction, you can change the initial attitudes of nonplayer characters. The DC of this check depends on the creature's starting attitude toward you, adjusted by its Charisma modifier. If you succeed, the character's attitude toward you is improved by one step. For every 5 by which your check result exceeds the DC, the character's attitude toward you increases by one additional step. A creature's attitude cannot be shifted more than two steps up in this way, although the GM can override this rule in some situations. You cannot use Diplomacy to influence a given creature's attitude more than once in a 24-hour period.
  
  | Starting Attitude |              DC              |
  |:------------------|:----------------------------:|
  | Hostile           | 25 + creature's Cha modifier |
  | Unfriendly        | 20 + creature's Cha modifier |
  | Indifferent       | 15 + creature's Cha modifier |
  | Friendly          | 10 + creature's Cha modifier |
  | Helpful           | 0 + creature's Cha modifier  |
  
  If you fail the check by 4 or less, the character's attitude toward you is unchanged. If you fail by 5 or more, the character's attitude toward you is decreased by one step.
  
  Any attitude shift caused through Diplomacy generally lasts for 1d4 hours but can last much longer or shorter depending upon the situation (GM discretion). As such, a Diplomacy check to change someone's attitude is mainly useful as a prelude to a follow-up request. It doesn't alter the creature's personality or goals. For instance, if a cunning bard managed to convince the evil necromancer queen to become friendly with him, that doesn't mean she will give up plans of world domination or change her deity from the goddess of undead to the goddess of beauty and love, but it does mean that she likes the bard now. Even without further requests, she would probably spare him if he pledges loyalty to her and if she thinks she can trust him. Even if she feels she can't trust him, she might at least be fond enough of him to transform him into a loyal undead servant so she can keep him around. Attempting to convince the necromancer queen to give up her evil ways and cease her plans for world conquest involves much more than a Diplomacy check to change her attitude toward the bard. The bard would then need to use the influence system or the relationship system to become closer to the necromancer queen, perhaps engaging in a verbal duel with her or even focusing an entire series of social adventures around changing her perspective.
  
  Using Diplomacy to improve a target's attitude is fairly open-ended and less fraught with circumstance modifiers than making a request, so when strapped for time or out of ideas, it is fine to omit a description of how a diplomat manages to do so. Using the previous example of the bard and the necromancer queen, the bard's request to spare a peasant so that she may spread word of the queen's mighty army and cause other villages to surrender without a fight is quite a different situation than him saying, "Spare this peasant woman because killing her is evil and makes my goddess sad," or even "Spare this peasant woman for me. Please?"
  
  **Make Request:** If a creature's attitude toward you is at least indifferent, you can make requests of the creature with 1 or more rounds of interaction. This is a Diplomacy check, using the creature's current attitude to determine the base DC, with one of the following modifiers. Once a creature's attitude has shifted to helpful, the creature gives in to most requests without a check, unless the request is against its nature or puts it in serious peril.
  
  | Request                                  |  DC Modifier   |
  |:-----------------------------------------|:--------------:|
  | Give simple advice or directions         |      --5       |
  | Give detailed advice                     |       +0       |
  | Give simple aid                          |       +0       |
  | Reveal an unimportant secret             |       +5       |
  | Give lengthy or complicated aid          |       +5       |
  | Give dangerous aid                       |      +10       |
  | Reveal an important secret               |  +10 or more   |
  | Give aid that could result in punishment |  +15 or more   |
  | Additional requests                      | +5 per request |
  
  Some requests automatically fail if the request goes against the creature's values or its nature, subject to GM discretion. If a request is refused, the result does not change with additional checks, although other requests might be made. In this vein, it is important to remember that no matter how high a Diplomacy roll may be, the target still has free will and won't accept certain requests. Even so, a character who declines a very high Diplomacy result should do so respectfully, as the high result means that the diplomat made her argument effectively and convincingly. For instance, a paladin who swore an oath to never unseal the inner catacombs of her faith's central cathedral might apologize and explain that though the argument to do so was convincing, she unfortunately can't violate this vow. A target who must refuse a request might try to honor the request in spirit, offering an alternative that might advance the same greater goal or doing a significant but still lesser favor for the requester.
  
  The nature of a request is crucial to determining its success or failure. Therefore, it is necessary to describe the request in order to attempt a Diplomacy check. A diplomat's player can't just say "I Diplomacy the guard." The player must provide a specific request along with any rationale supporting that desire, even if the player or GM doesn't want to roleplay the whole interaction in character.
  
  *Requests in Combat:* In this case of calling for a cease-fire in combat, and in other instances of requests made to unfriendly or hostile characters, the GM should consider allowing such requests if they are couched in such a way that they seem to be in the target's best interests. An unfriendly or hostile character certainly isn't going to be doing the would-be diplomat any favors, but that doesn't mean they will ignore an idea that is better for them than facing the consequences of the combat. Even if adversaries agree to a brief cease-fire to listen to the diplomat's terms, they won't let their guard down. Generally, they will also require the side calling for the cease-fire to make a show of their intentions by laying down or sheathing their weapons, dropping spell component pouches, or the like, while attempting Sense Motive checks to determine if the cease-fire is a ruse. Creatures that feel themselves to be at an advantage in the combat by virtue of a short-duration spell or other effect that would expire during a cease-fire almost never agree to a cease-fire, as it isn't in their best interest to do so.
  
  **Gather Information:** You can also use Diplomacy to gather information about a specific topic or individual. To do this, you must spend at least 1d4 hours canvassing people at local taverns, markets, and gathering places. The DC of this check depends on the obscurity of the information sought, but for most commonly known facts or rumors it is 10. For obscure or secret knowledge, the DC might increase to 20 or higher. Because this use of Diplomacy often produces similar results to those of a high Knowledge (local) check, adventurers might be able to attempt either one to gain the same information. When a PC fails at a Knowledge (local) check, the GM can give the character a second chance by having him spend time attempting to gather that information from others.
  
  The GM might rule that some topics are simply unknown to common folk. The information that people know is typically limited to the area where they live, and is filtered through their biases. In a city on the brink of a race war between elves and humans, the information available among the upper-class human nobility will have a significantly different spin and tone to it than the information available in the elven ghetto, and the checks to gather information in those places would meet with circumstance bonuses or penalties depending on who was asking where. Thus, it is important to decide where a character is gathering information before determining what information they receive. Filtering the information through the biases of the community adds flavor and nuance to the world around the characters.
  
  Gathering information is itself a conspicuous act, so others who are gathering information can usually notice it in turn. A typical DC for hearing about someone else gathering information should start at 15, and a character wishing to gather information clandestinely can choose to take a penalty on her Diplomacy check to increase that DC by the same amount.
  
  **Hypnotism:** You must be trained in Survival and be capable of casting psychic spells or who have the Psychic Sensitivity feat to use this functionality of the skill. You can use hypnotism once per day. The DC of a Diplomacy check to hypnotize is 20 + the subject’s Will save modifier against mind-affecting enchantment (compulsion) effects. All uses of hypnotism are mind-affecting enchantment (compulsion) effects.
  
  *Implant Suggestion:* You can implant a suggested course of reasonable action in the mind of a willing creature, along with a defined trigger. To implant a suggestion, you spend 1 minute inducing a trance-like state in the subject, after which you attempt a Diplomacy check. If the check is successful, you implant the course of action, as a suggestion spell with a duration of 10 minutes plus 10 additional minutes for every 1 by which your check result exceeds the DC. If the subject ceases to be willing, it can attempt a Will save once each round to shake off the effects. The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Charisma modifier. You can attempt to subtly implant a suggestion in the mind of an unwilling creature with an attitude of indifferent or better after 1 minute of continuous, calm interaction with that creature, but the DC is 10 higher.
  
  *Recall Memory:* You can draw out forgotten memories from a willing subject. You spend 1 minute inducing a calming, trance-like state in the subject, after which you attempt a Diplomacy check. If you succeed at the check, the hypnotized creature can reroll any previously failed Intelligence or Knowledge check to recall the forgotten information with a +4 bonus. The information must be something the subject once knew or was exposed to.

  **Identify Aura:** This works as the identify aura functionality of Spellcraft, except that you can also identify auras on creatures.
  
  **Identify Power Effect:** You can identify a power that's already in place and in effect. You must be able to see or detect the effects of the power.
  
  **Identify Psionic Creation:** You can identify materials created or shaped by psionics, such as noting that a particular object was created using a metacreativity power.
  
  **Identify Targeted Power:** After rolling a saving throw against a power targeted on you, you can try to determine what that power was.

  **Identify Spell or Power:** Identifying a spell or power as it is being cast or manifested requires no action, but you must be able to clearly see or sense the spell or power as it is being cast or manifested, and this incurs the same penalties as a Perception skill check due to distance, poor conditions, and other factors.
  
  **Learn Written Spell:** You can learn a spell from a spellbook or scroll. If the spell is 0-level, it only takes 30 minutes.
  
  **Identify Aura:** As part of using *detect magic*, *identify*, or *detect psionics*, you can potentially determine the spell school or psionic discipline involved in the aura of a single item (but not creature) you can see. (If the aura is not a spell or power effect, the DC is 15 + 1/2 caster or manifester level.)
  
  **Decipher Written Spell:** With a full-round action, you can determine what spell or spells are contained by an item like a scroll.
  
  **Address Power Stone:** With a full-round action, you can address a power stone to figure out what power or powers it contains.
  
  **Identify Psionic Tattoo:** With 1 minute of concentration, you can identify a psionic tattoo.
  
  **Enhance Dimensional Anchor:** With 10 minutes, you can draw a diagram to enhance the casting of *dimensional anchor* or manifestation of *psionic dimensional anchor* on a summoned creature. The player does not see the result of this check.
  
  **Craft Magic or Psionic Item:** Making a Spellcraft check to craft a magic or psionic item is made as part of the creation process.
  
  **Understand Unique Magic or Psionic Effect:** You can understand a strange or unique magic or psionic effect, such as the effects of an outcrop of psionically resonant crystal.
  
  ## Skill Unlocks
  
  If you have the [Signature Skill](/feats/signature-skill/) feat, the rogue's edge ability, or another ability that grants you the skill unlocks for this skill, you gain access to the following abilities when you have sufficient ranks.
  
  **5 Ranks:** Identifying magic items takes 1 full round, and the time required to learn a spell from a spellbook is halved.
  
  **10 Ranks:** You can identify magic items without using [*detect magic*](/spells/detect-magic/), though the DC is increased by 10.
  
  **15 Ranks:** Identifying magic items is a standard action, and the time required to learn a new spell from a spellbook is reduced to 1 minute per spell level.
  
  **20 Ranks:** Whenever you attempt a caster level check, attempt a Spellcraft check at a --20 penalty at the same DC. If the Spellcraft check succeeds, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on your caster level check.

  With 1d3 Ã— 10 minutes of work, you can change your appearance. Generally, Bluff checks cover telling actual lies to support a disguise, whereas Disguise checks cover the other aspects, such as imitating mannerisms and speech. Your Disguise check result determines how good the disguise is, and it is opposed by others' Perception check results. If you don't draw any attention to yourself, others do not get to make Perception checks. If you come to the attention of people who are suspicious (such as a guard who is watching commoners walking through a city gate), it can be assumed that such observers are taking 10 on their Perception checks. An individual makes a Perception check to see through your disguise immediately upon meeting you and again every hour thereafter. If you casually meet a large number of different creatures, each for a short time, check once per day or hour, using an average Perception modifier for the group.
  
  You get only one Disguise check per use of the skill, even if several people make Perception checks against it. Further Disguise checks might be necessary for things such as altering one's voice or using appropriate mannerisms or phrasing, but the basic disguise doesn't require further checks. The Disguise check is made secretly, so that you can't be sure how good the result is. One way to handle this is to roll the Disguise check secretly only the first time it truly comes into opposition. You may try to redo a failed disguise, but once others know that a disguise was attempted, they'll be more suspicious.
  
  The effectiveness of your disguise depends on how much you're changing your appearance. Disguise can be used to make yourself appear like a creature that is one size category larger or smaller than your actual size. This does not change your actual size or reach, should you enter combat while wearing such a disguise.
  
  Magic that alters your form, such as *alter self*, *disguise self*, *polymorph*, or *shapechange*, grants you a +10 bonus on Disguise checks (see the individual spell descriptions). Divination magic that allows people to see through illusions (such as *true seeing*) does not penetrate a mundane disguise, but it can negate the magical component of a magically enhanced one. Thus, a true master of disguise uses both types of trickery, and she also ensures that the person who notices her use of magic has a way to explain the fact that disguise magic was involved at all. For instance, a rogue might disguise herself as a noble with mundane means and then use [*disguise self*](/spells/disguises-self/) to cloak herself in a glamer of that same noble, but more beautiful. Then, if someone sees through the illusion but not the mundane disguise, he would just think she was a vain noble instead of becoming suspicious due to the use of illusion magic and demanding a more thorough inspection.
  
  | Disguise                             | Check Modifier (cumulative) |
  |:-------------------------------------|:---------------------------:|
  | Minor details only                   |             +5              |
  | Disguised as different gender        |             --2             |
  | Disguised as different race          |             --2             |
  | Disguised as different age category  |      --2 per category       |
  | Disguised as different size category |            --10             |
  
  The age categories are: young (younger than adulthood), adulthood, middle age, old, and venerable.
  
  If you are impersonating a particular individual, those who know what that person looks like get a bonus on their Perception checks according to the table below. Furthermore, they are automatically considered to be suspicious of you, so opposed checks are always called for.

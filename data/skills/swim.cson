  You can't take 10 on a Swim check in stormy water, even if you aren't otherwise being threatened or distracted.
  
  Each hour that you swim, you must make a DC 20 Swim check or take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage from fatigue.
  
  A creature with a swim speed can move through water at its indicated speed without making Swim checks. It gains a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform a special action or avoid a hazard. The creature can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered when swimming. Such a creature can use the run action while swimming, provided that it swims in a straight line.
  
  Make a Swim check once per round while you are in the water. Success means you may swim at up to half your speed (as a full-round action) or at a quarter of your speed (as a move action). If you fail by 4 or less, you make no progress. If you fail by 5 or more, you go underwater. The DC for the Swim check depends on the water, as given on the table below.
  
  | Water conditions | DC |
  |:-----------------|:--:|
  | Calm water       | 10 |
  | Rough water      | 15 |
  | Stormy water     | 20 |
  
  **Hold Breath:** If you are underwater, either because you failed a Swim check or because you are swimming underwater intentionally, you must hold your breath. You can hold your breath for a number of rounds equal to twice your Constitution score, but only if you do nothing other than take move actions or free actions. If you take a standard action or a full-round action (such as making an attack), the remainder of the duration for which you can hold your breath is reduced by 1 round. (Effectively, a character in combat can hold his breath only half as long as normal.) After that period of time, you must make a DC 10 Constitution check every round to continue holding your breath. Each round, the DC for that check increases by 1. If you fail the Constitution check, you begin to drown.
  
  ## Skill Unlocks
  
  If you have the [Signature Skill](/feats/signature-skill/) feat, the rogue's edge ability, or another ability that grants you the skill unlocks for this skill, you gain access to the following abilities when you have sufficient ranks.
  
  **5 Ranks:** You gain a swim speed of 10 feet, but only in water with a Swim DC of 15 or lower.
  
  **10 Ranks:** You gain a swim speed (though you do not gain the +8 racial bonus on Swim checks) equal to your base speed in water with a Swim DC of 15 or lower, or 10 feet in all other water.
  
  **15 Ranks:** You ignore the penalties for using slashing or bludgeoning weapons underwater, as [*freedom of movement*](/spells/freedom-of-movement/).
  
  **20 Ranks:** You gain a swim speed equal to your base speed in all water. If you have both hands free, you gain a +8 racial bonus on Swim checks.

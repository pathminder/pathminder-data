  **Identify Aura:** This works as the identify aura functionality of [Spellcraft](/skills/spellcraft/), except that you can also identify auras on creatures.
  
  **Identify Spell Effect:** You can identify a spell that's already in place and in effect. You must be able to see or detect the effects of the spell.
  
  **Identify Magic Creation:** You can identify materials created or shaped by magic, such as noting that a particular object was created using a transmutation spell.
  
  **Identify Targeted Spell:** After rolling a saving throw against a spell targeted on you, you can try to determine what that spell was.
  
  **Phrenology:** You must be trained in Knowledge (arcana) and be capable of casting psychic spells or who have the Psychic Sensitivity feat to use this functionality of the skill. Once per day, you can use your fingertips to examine the shape of a creature's skull.
  
  Reading a creature's skull requires 1 minute of concentration and scrutiny while you physically manipulate the skull. This technique can be used on a willing, helpless, or paralyzed creature, or on decomposed remains (as long as the skull is intact or can be pieced together). This skill can't be used on creatures without discernible skulls, such as constructs, elementals, oozes, or plants.
  
  After the minute is up, the GM attempts a secret Knowledge (arcana) check. The DC is typically modified by the subject's Hit Dice. (A dead creature's skull uses the HD the creature had when alive.) With a single check, you determine all the information whose DC you meet. For instance, if you had a result of 22 when examining a creature with 2 HD, you would learn that creature's race and age, gender, alignment, and class, but not its level or HD.

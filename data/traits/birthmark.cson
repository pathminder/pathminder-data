  You were born with a strange birthmark that looks very similar to the holy symbol of the god you chose to worship later in life. This birthmark can serve you as a divine focus for casting spells, and as a physical manifestation of your faith, it increases your devotion to your godâ€”you gain a +2 trait bonus on all saving throws against charm and compulsion effects as a result.

  As a child, your parents sent you to a distant wizard's tower as an apprentice so that you might learn the arcane arts. Unfortunately, you had no arcane talent whatsoever, though you did learn a great deal about the workings of spells and how to resist them. You gain a +1 trait bonus on saves against arcane spells.

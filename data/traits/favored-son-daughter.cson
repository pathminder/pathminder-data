  You were born and raised in the the local town or its surrounding farms. You know many of the region's secrets, and the locals already know who you are. You are well liked in town, and you'll have lots of friends in the region, but the town's tougher side sees you as a snitch or a pansy. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Knowledge (local) checks, and Knowledge (local) is always a class skill for you. In addition, you can choose any one law-abiding citizen of the town from below as an ally; depending on the person you pick, you'll get different benefits.
  
  **Tavern Owner:** One of the town's most influential and beloved nobles. Her inn/tavern is the most popular in town, and as one of her friends, you're guaranteed a place to eat and sleep for free. She's got lots of great contacts with merchants as well, and she'll sell any of your loot for youâ€”as a result, you gain an additional 10% over the amount of gp you normally would get from selling off treasure.
  
  **Sherrif:** The no nonsense arm of the law, is like the uncle you never had. The benefits of being close friends with the town sheriff are extensive, and you can call in favors from him once per game session. A favor can either get you out of a legal jam, hook you up with a town guard for help, or give you a one-time +10 bonus on a Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate check made against any local person.

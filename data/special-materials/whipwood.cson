  Vanara woodworkers craft this extremely flexible material in a time-consuming process. Whipwood is actually a composite of several bendable wooden fibers woven and fused together to form a flexible but sturdy unit. Only wooden weapons or weapons with wooden hafts (such as axes and spears) can be made out of whipwood. A creature wielding a whipwood weapon treats its CMD as +2 higher for the purpose of avoiding sunder attempts against that weapon. A whipwood weapon's hit points increase by +5. Whipwood loses its special qualities if under the effect of an [*ironwood*](/spells/ironwood/) spell.

  You turn into dark mist that crackles with negative energy. You may initiate this counter in response to a melee or ranged attack being made against you. Until the beginning of your next turn, you are immune to weapon damage, and spells targeted against you have a 50% miss chance. If you initiated this counter in response to a melee attack, the creature attacking you suffers 7d8 points of negative energy damage.

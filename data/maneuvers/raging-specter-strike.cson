text: '''
  You transmute your weapon into a semi-ethereal state, striking with the undying hate of a specter. Make a melee attack against your opponent's touch AC. If it hits, it deals weapon damage as normal. Unlike normal touch attacks, you may use Power Attack to enhance the damage dealt by this maneuver.

  You draw upon the destructive entropy of the negative energy plane, infusing it into your strikes. When you initiate this boost, your melee attacks ignore hardness and overcome an amount of damage reduction equal to your initiator level for 1 round.
  
  **Grave Call:** Attacks by undead creatures initiating this boost overcome damage reduction entirely for the duration of this boost.

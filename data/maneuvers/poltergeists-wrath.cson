text: '''
  You strike out with your weapon and emit a wave of rage and sorrow that brings your victim to their knees. Choose a creature within range, then make a melee attack against that creature (even if you don't threaten the chosen creature). If it hits, it deals weapon damage as normal, plus an additional 6d8 points of negative energy damage, and your victim is knocked prone (no save).

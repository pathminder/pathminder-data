text: '''
  You mimic the savage fury of the undying, breaking the bodies of your foes. Make a melee attack. If it hits, it deals weapon damage as normal, plus an additional 1d4 points of damage to a physical ability score of your choice. This ability damage ignores the normal immunity to physical ability damage enjoyed by undead creatures, though they still cannot suffer Constitution damage.

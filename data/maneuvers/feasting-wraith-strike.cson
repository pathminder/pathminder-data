text: '''
  Sickly gray tar clings to your blade as you initiate this dread strike. Make a melee attack. If it hits, it deals weapon damage as normal plus 2d4 points of Constitution damage, and your victim becomes shaken for a number of rounds equal to your initiation modifier. A successful Will save halves the Constitution damage and prevents the shaken condition.

summary: "Your armor gains the ghost touch special property, and you may move through solid objects as though incorporeal."
text: '''
  When you assume this stance, your outline smudges gently and your hair and equipment become semi-transparent, as though you had become a ghost. While you maintain this stance, your armor has the *ghost touch* property (even if it is not otherwise magical) and you---along with your worn, carried, or held equipment---may move through solid objects as though you were incorporeal, provided you do not end your movement within a solid object.

text: '''
  Your weapon screams like a grieving banshee as you drive it into your foe. Make a melee attack. If it hits, it deals weapon damage as normal, plus an additional 4d8 points of negative energy damage, and the creature struck becomes deafened for a number of rounds equal to your initiation modifier.

text: '''
  Your head vanishes when you assume this stance, leaving behind a dripping, bloody neck stump (this may complicate attempts to identify you). You suffer no ill effects from not having a head, such as blindness or an inability to utilize potions or head slot items. While maintaining this stance, you do not provoke attacks of opportunity for moving through threatened spaces (you may still provoke attacks of opportunity for other reasons). Furthermore, you and other allies within 30 ft. deal additional negative energy damage equal to your initiator level against creatures you are flanking. Your other allies do not necessarily have to also be flanking such creatures.
  
  **Grave Call:** Additionally, an undead creature maintaining this stance may imbue its mount with this power; its mount does not provoke attacks of opportunity for moving through threatened squares (it might still provoke attacks of opportunity for other reasons).

      An awakened blade adds either Riven Hourglass or Sleeping Goddess to his list of available disciplines. If he does not have that discipline's associated skill as a class skill, he gains it as a class skill.
      
      At every even-number level, an awakened blade gains new maneuvers known from any discipline he has access to (whether from a martial disciple class, Awakened Blade, or the [Martial Training](/feats/martial-training/) feat). He must meet a maneuver’s prerequisites to learn it. The character adds his full awakened blade levels to his initiator level to determine his total initiator level and his highest-level maneuvers known.
      
      At 3rd, 6th, and 9th levels, he gains additional maneuvers readied per day, and and 2nd, 5th, and 8th levels he may exchange a known maneuver for a different maneuver that he qualifies for.
      
      *Stances Known:* At 3rd level and again at 8th level, the awakened blade learns a new martial stance from his available disciplines. He must meet the stance’s prerequisites to learn it.

      At every level but 1st and 6th, an awakened blade gains additional power points per day and access to new powers as if he had also gained a level in whatever manifesting class he belonged to before he added the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (bonus feats, metapsionic or item creation feats, and so on). This essentially means that he adds the level of awakened blade to the level of whatever manifesting class the character has, and then determines power points per day, powers known, and manifester level accordingly.
      
      If a character had more than one manifesting class before he became an awakened blade, he must decide to which class he adds the new level of awakened blade for the purpose of determining power points per day, powers known, and manifester level.

He may also add this bonus to his AC as a dodge bonus or Reflex saves to avoid traps and their attacks. This bonus stacks with bonuses gained from the trap sense class feature.

This inner sense allows the awakened blade to react to danger quickly, guide his attacks around the defenses of his enemies, and to land fierce blows as his mind traces out the myriad scenarios that could play out between himself and his foes. To enter this stance, as a swift action the awakened blade abandons a martial stance he is currently using. While in this stance, the character gains a +1 insight bonus for every three initiator levels he possesses (minimum +1) to his AC, attack and damage rolls, CMB checks, and to all saving throws. If caught in a situation where the character would be denied his Dexterity bonus, these bonuses do not apply. The character inflicts an additional 1d6 points of damage while in this stance at 2nd level, and this damage bonus improves to 2d6 points of damage at 7th level. This bonus damage is precision based, and creatures not subject to critical hits are immune to this additional damage."

At 7th level, to use this ability, the character expends a readied maneuver and his psionic focus as an immediate action; the clairsentient counter is used in response to attack against him of any sort (be it a melee or ranged attack, spell, power, or other spell-like or supernatural effect) and grants the character a standard or move action that he must use as part of this counter. This movement occurs before the attack is resolved but after the attack is made."

He may continue to gain these benefits while he adopts any other martial stance that he knows and gain the benefits of both stances."

text: '''
  Some wielders of psychic power seek to extend and stretch the depths of their psionic power to assist their abilities in many different ways. Some small select few, those who are quite gifted in the clairsentient arts, find that they are able to distil certain psionic powers into a fighting style of extreme potency. The style is a deadly mix of precognition abilities coupled with martial techniques that when utilized together, allows for its user to react to danger faster and defend himself while simultaneously mapping out his foe’s defenses for maximum effect. Awakened blades, as they are called, learn to use their precognitive mastery as both offense and defense in pursuit of greater psionic knowledge and personal glory or power.

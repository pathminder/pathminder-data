  Anyone peering into this bag of deep gray cloth sees nothing but empty blackness. Within the bag exists an extradimensional space linked to the Plane of Shadow. Three times per day, as a move action, the bearer can reach within the bag and pull out 1d4 semisolid shards of shadow. The bag's bearer can use each shard of shadow as a thrown weapon targeting a single 5-foot square. When it hits, it acts as a [*darkness*](/spells/darkness/) spell, but only affecting one 5-foot square. As a move action, the bearer of the bag can move a shadow cloud up to 10 feet in any direction. Whether or not they are thrown, the shards of shadow and shadow clouds last 10 minutes before dissipating.

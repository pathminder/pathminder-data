  This radiant crown of steel is bedecked with miniature mithral swords. A *crown of swords* can be used up to 10 times per day. When struck in combat, the wearer may spend one use as an immediate action to create a longsword-shaped [*spiritual weapon*](/spells/spiritual-weapon/) that then attacks her attacker. On the wearer's next turn, she may spend one additional use each round to continue attacking that target with the *spiritual weapon*; the *spiritual weapon* cannot be redirected and disappears if the target is killed or moves out of range. Multiple *spiritual weapons* may be created (even attacking the same target) if the wearer is attacked in subsequent rounds.

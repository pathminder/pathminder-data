text: '''
  This unassuming cloak initially appears to be made of plain leather. When the wearer speaks the command word, however, the cloak of the scuttling rat wraps itself around the individual, transforming her into a dire rat as if using [*beast shape I*](/spells/beast-shape-i/). The wearer can remain in dire rat form for up to 5 minutes per day. This duration need not be consecutive, but it must be used in 1-minute increments.

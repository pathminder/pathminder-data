  This small iron locket contains some token---a scale, a shaving of a horn or claw, or lock of burning hair---from a fiend. When worn by a [tiefling](/races/tieflings/), if he has cold, electricity, or fire resistance, this amulet increases that resistance by 5. Furthermore, it provides a +4 insight bonus on Diplomacy skill checks made to influence evil outsiders.

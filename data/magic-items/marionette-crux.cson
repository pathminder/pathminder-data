text: '''
  Short lengths of twine dangle sharp metal needles from each end of this cross-shaped wooden bar. To use a *marionette crux*, the wielder points the item at any humanoid within 25 feet and makes a ranged touch attack as a standard action as the strings suddenly extend out. If the attack hits, the needles pierce the victim's wrists and ankles, causing the victim to become sickened for 1 round by the momentary flash of pain. In addition, the victim must make a DC 17 Will save to avoid being dominated by the *crux*, as if via [*dominate person*](/spells/dominate-person/).
  
  The needles immediately retract back to the *crux* an instant after they strike a foe, but if the victim has been dominated, the *crux*'s wielder can control its actions. Control lies with the *crux*, not the person who made the initial attack---passing the *crux* to another creature allows that creature to take control of the dominated humanoid. If the *crux* is given to the victim, the effect ends. The *crux* must be held in the user's hand in order for the user to issue a new command to the victim. Otherwise, the domination effect caused by a *marionette crux* lasts for a day, but additional uses of the *crux* can effectively extend the effect over a victim indefinitely. A *marionette crux* can maintain domination over only one creature at a time---if a second humanoid is dominated by the *crux*, the previously dominated humanoid is released from the effect immediately. A *marionette crux* can be activated up to two times per day.

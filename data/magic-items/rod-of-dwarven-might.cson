text: '''
  This dwarven version of the more famous *rod of lordly might* has no spell-like powers; however, when wielded by a dwarf, it increases all AC, attack roll, CMD, CMB, and saving throw bonuses from a dwarf's racial traits by +1. The rod shares the mundane powers of a *rod of lordly might*, but its magical weapon forms are tailored to dwarven preferences.
  
  In its normal form, the rod can be used as a +1 returning light hammer.
  
  When button 1 is pushed, the rod becomes a +3 dwarven longhammer.
  
  When button 2 is pushed, the rod becomes a +4 dwarven waraxe.
  
  When button 3 is pushed, the rod becomes a +2 light crossbow or +2 heavy crossbow.

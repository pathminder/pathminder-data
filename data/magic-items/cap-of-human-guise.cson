text: '''
  This threadbare hat allows its wearer to alter her appearance as with a [*disguise self*](/spells/disguise-self/) spell, except she can only appear as a plainly dressed Small human child, adult halfling, or adult gnome, such as a peasant, blacksmith, or shopkeeper. The wearer can slightly alter the cap's appearance as part of the disguise, but otherwise must match the overall unremarkable look of the illusory form.

  This narrow cloth belt has a silver buckle in the shape of four rings. The belt allows a creature to wear a magic ring on each foot in addition to the ring on each hand, though only two rings function at any given time. As a swift action, the wearer can change which of his rings are active (both hands, both feet, left hand and right foot, and so on). For example, a creature could wear a *ring of protection*, *ring of energy resistance*, *ring of swimming*, and *ring of counterspells*, switching between any two of them as a swift action each round as it desires.
  
  The belt does not change the type of action required to activate a ring (for example, activating a *ring of invisibility* is still a standard action), but allows the wearer to easily switch between the constant powers of several worn rings. While the belt is worn, wearing a ring on a foot counts toward the attunement process of certain rings (such as a *ring of sustenance*) even if the belt isn't used to make that ring active during that attunement period.

  This silvery ornament is shaped like a spider and worn on a thick strand of silk. The medallion is made from a tough but vaguely spongy and sticky substance, and it once belonged to the a famed witch, known for her spiderlike abilities and the spider swarms she commanded.
  
  The witch was adept at using the silk from her scarlet spider familiar to create clothes, jewelry, and, when necessary, particularly effective webs to trap her enemies. She fashioned this very medallion from that silk and wore it every day of her adult life. When she died, the magic from the witch's familiar leaked into the bauble, imbuing it with latent magic.
  
  An [occultist](/base-classes/occultist/) of 3rd level or higher who has learned the conjuration implement school and uses the *spidersilk medallion* as an implement has access to the following focus power.
  
  **Mindweave Web (Sp):** As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to create a [*web*](/spells/web/), as per the spell. This *web* lasts for 1 minute per occultist level you have. Creatures in the effect's area when the *web* is created can attempt a DC 15 Reflex saving throw to avoid being grappled. At 7th level, you can expend 1 additional point of mental focus when creating this *web* to render the entire *web* non-flammable. When you create a *web* in this way, its duration is reduced to 1 round per occultist level you have. *Webs* created using a *spidersilk medallion* cannot be made permanent.

  This ebon rod is so dark it seems to absorb the light around it. The rod functions as a *+2 light mace*, and allows its wielder to see in darkness as if it had the see in darkness ability. Three times per day, the wielder can use it to create a [*deeper darkness*](/spells/deeper-darkness/) effect (caster level 8th). To use this ability, the rod's wielder must touch the object affected, which is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity.

  This *+2 ghost touch tower shield* is engraved with funerary runes depicting the peaceful rest of the contented dead. The wielder of an *elysian shield* is immune to the create spawn ability of undead, and once per day as an immediate action can negate a single energy drain, ability drain, or ability damage attack by an undead creature. In addition, once per day as a standard action, the wielder can release a wave of positive energy that panics undead, as the [Turn Undead](/feats/turn-undead/) feat (DC 20 Will negates).

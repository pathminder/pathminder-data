text: '''
  An *aegis of recovery* grants its wearer a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws made to recover from an effect, such as poison or lingering damage from an attack. This bonus does not help against preliminary saving throws against such effects. Should the wearer ever drop below 0 hit points, the *aegis* cures 2d8+3 points of damage to the wearer and then crumbles, becoming useless from then on.

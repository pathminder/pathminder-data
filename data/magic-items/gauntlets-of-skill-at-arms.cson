  These finely crafted leather gauntlets have plates of silvered steel covering the back, and silver buckles at the wrist and forearm. The gloves enable the wearer to use any traditional elven weapon (longbows, composite longbows, longswords, rapiers, shortbows, composite shortbows, and any weapon with the word "elven" in its name) as if he were proficient in its use. If he uses such a weapon and is already proficient with it, he gains a +1 competence bonus on attack and damage rolls. Both gauntlets must be worn for the magic to be effective.

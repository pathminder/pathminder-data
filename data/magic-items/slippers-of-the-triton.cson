  Once they are slipped on, these web-toed slippers allow the wearer to breathe water and grant extra maneuverability while within such environments. If the wearer has no swim speed, it gains a 30 foot swim speed. If the wearer has a swim speed, it gains a +10 foot enhancement bonus to its swim speed.

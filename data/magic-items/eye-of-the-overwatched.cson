  The *eye of the overwatched* is a 6-inch-wide stone ring inset with the symbol of a partly lidded eye. The flawless marble of onyx that's set as the eye's pupil contains glittering points of light that resemble stars.
  
  Made from the exotic mineral called veinstone, the *eye of the overwatched* is an ancient amulet crafted by a mad wizard. While he lived, the wizard used his observatory to study otherworldly forces. In turn, those forces watched him, and he became increasingly paranoid as a result. Just before he disappeared following a duel with another mage, the wizard constructed this amulet in hopes that it would protect him from his perceived spellcaster enemies.
  
  He failed to create a traditional magic item, but an [occultist](/base-classes/occultist/) who has learned the abjuration implement school and uses the *eye of the overwatched* as an implement can use the following focus power.
  
  **Spellarmor (Sp):** As a swift action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to try to shake off unwanted magical effects. If you are under the effect of an enemy's spell or spell-like ability when you activate this ward, you immediately receive a new saving throw with a +2 circumstance bonus. This focus power does not grant a saving throw if the original effect did not allow one.

  Favored by half-elves seeking to distill their heritage into a combat edge, an *ancestral clasp* resembles a metal tube, open on both sides and covered in delicate elven calligraphy. Whenever a half-elf fits an *ancestral clasp* to the pommel, grip, or haft of a longbow, longsword, rapier, or shortbow, the character is treated as though she were proficient with that weapon. In addition, when an *ancestral clasp* is fitted to any weapon with the word "elven" in the title, the character treats the weapon as if it were a martial weapon, mirroring the weapon familiarity elven racial trait. A half-elf who already is proficient with one of the above weapons adorned with an *ancestral clasp* receives a +1 insight bonus on attack rolls with that weapon. Although this ability stems from the item's magic, the affected weapon is treated as nonmagical for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Affixing and removing an *ancestral clasp* is a standard action.

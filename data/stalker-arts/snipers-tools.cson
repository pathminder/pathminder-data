  The stalker chooses a ranged weapon he is proficient with, and gains the benefits of the Point Blank Shot and Precise Shot feats when using that weapon. At 6th level and every five levels thereafter, the stalker chooses an additional ranged weapon to gain the benefits of this ability with. The stalker can change one of these weapon choices by practicing with a new weapon for ten minutes. This stalker art counts as both Point Blank Shot and Precise Shot for the purposes of meeting prerequisites.

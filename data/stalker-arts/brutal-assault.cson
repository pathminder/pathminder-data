  As a swift action, the brutal slayer can spend a point of *ki* and target a single creature he can see. He gains the benefit of his brutal strikes ability when making attacks against that creature for a number of rounds equal to his initiation modifier.
  
  The stalker must have the brutal strikes class feature to select this stalker art.

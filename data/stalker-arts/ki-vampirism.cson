text: '''
  The stalker's *ki* gains a hungry quality that expresses itself through the martial prowess of a disciple of the Path of War. If the stalker reduces a living foe to 0 or less hit points with a martial strike or scores a successful critical hit, then he may regain 1 point of *ki* as an immediate action. He may not use his *ki* vampirism more times per day than 3 + his Wisdom modifier. This ability does not function against constructs, undead, or creatures with under 1‚ÅÑ2 HD. Minimum stalker level 11th.

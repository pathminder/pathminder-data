  The stalker may use his deadly strikes in conjunction with his combat insight to "read" his opponent's defenses and effortlessly attack beyond his foe's guard. The stalker spends one point of *ki* as a swift action to read his target opponent, and may apply his deadly strike to all of his attacks for a number of rounds equal to his Wisdom modifier against this target. If the stalker scores a successful critical hit against the target while his deadly strike ability is active, the duration of this ability is extended by one round (no more than one extension can be made per round).

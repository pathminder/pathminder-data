text: '''
  A stalker can avoid damage from many area-effect attacks by channeling his *ki* into his reflexes. If a stalker makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful Reflex save he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if a stalker is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless stalker does not gain the benefit of evasion.

  The stalker chooses a melee weapon he is proficient with, and gains the benefits of the Weapon Finesse and Deadly feats when using that weapon, even if that weapon could not normally be used with those feats. At 6th level and every five levels thereafter, the stalker chooses an additional melee weapon to gain the benefits of this ability with. The stalker can change one of these weapon choices by practicing with a new weapon for ten minutes. This stalker art counts as both Weapon Finesse and [Deadly Agility](/feats/deadly-agility/) for the purposes of meeting prerequisites.

text: '''
  The stalker designates his combat senses towards his opponents and gains momentary flashes of insight into how to defend himself against them. Spending one point of *ki* as an immediate action forces opponents who attack the stalker to roll their attack rolls twice and take the worse of the two results due to the stalker's precognitive abilities. This art has a duration of 1 + the stalker's Wisdom modifier in rounds.

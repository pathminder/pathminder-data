  The stalker may utilize his *ki*-fueled attunement to the world around him to defend himself while he centers his spirit for martial maneuver recovery. When recovering maneuvers (either as a full round action or as a standard action) the stalker enjoys concealment (with a 20% miss chance). At 11th level, this improves to total concealment (50% miss chance).

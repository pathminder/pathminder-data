  The stalker's inner sense learns the workings of another being's mind, granting him the ability to impose his own will over those weak enough to succumb to this art. As a standard action, the character spends one *ki* point and must make eye contact with the target creature and begin speaking to them, using his *ki* to influence his target's thoughts. The target then must make a Will save (DC 13 + the stalker's Wisdom modifier) or be subject to a *charm monster* spell. Minimum stalker level 5th.

  Through a ceremony of meditation and recitation, the casters of this ritual become psychically attuned.
  
  Casters who don't have levels in an occult class gain the following benefits.
  
  - Each caster can choose one knack from the psychic class's spell list and an additional knack for every 5 character levels that caster possesses (to a maximum of 5 knacks at 20th level). The casters can cast these knacks at will.
  - If a caster is trained in a skill with an occult skill unlock, she can use that skill's occult unlock.
  
  Casters who do have levels in an occult base class gain the following benefits.
  
  - If a caster is trained in a skill with an occult skill unlock, she gains a +4 insight bonus on checks with that skill when using its occult skill unlock.
  - If a caster is untrained in a skill with an occult skill unlock, she can still use that skill's occult unlock.
  
  Each of the ritual's casters can choose to dismiss this ritual's effects for themselves individually.

  Through a process of reaching mutual understanding and agreeing on a shared goal, the casters of this ritual are joined in the pursuit of knowledge. Each secondary caster holds on to a section of long copper wire, while the primary caster questions them. Only when assured of the purity of joint purpose among all casters does the primary caster permit the other casters to let go of the wire, successfully completing the ritual.
  
  Failure by the primary caster to conduct this purpose-driven interrogation, or by the secondary casters to withstand it, can lead to severe mental trauma for all involved.
  
  While devoting the remainder of the day to research and study, each caster can choose one of the following bonuses after the ritual's completion.
  
  - Decrease the time necessary to attempt an untrained Knowledge check by using a library (as per the Knowledge skill) to 1 hour.
  - Gain a +5 insight bonus on all Knowledge checks of one type for the remainder of the day.
  - While using a library or similar research resource, replace a required Knowledge check with a Perception check at a --5 penalty.
  - Reroll any one Knowledge check attempted over the course of the day.

failure: "The portal creates a temporary one-way link with a random location, immediately delivering a hostile creature as though via [*summon monster VI*](/spells/summon-monster-vi/). At the GM's discretion, the creature may be accompanied by 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 5th-level *summon monster* list, or 1d4+1 creatures of the same type from a lower-level list."
text: '''
  By repairing damaged magical runes and realigning the energies based on the gate's planetary position, the caster reactivates a dormant *aiudara*. A reactivated gate automatically reconnects with its linked twin, acting as a two-way [*gate*](/spells/gate/) (as per the spell) between the locations. The caster knows the gate's password---which might be anything from an Elven phrase to a song's refrain to a spell---from the research required to learn this ritual. All other creatures who use this gate must also know the password to access the gate's magic after it has been reactivated.

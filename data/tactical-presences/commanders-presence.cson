  The bannerman is a true commander amongst warlords, allowing him to lend a readied maneuver to an ally within 30-ft. as a swift action. When he lends this maneuver, the maneuver is expended until the recipient initiates this maneuver (using the recipient's initiator level and Charisma modifier to determine the saving throw DC; if the recipient's initiator level is too low to initiate the maneuver, then the bannerman cannot lend the maneuver). He can only lend one maneuver at a time when using this presence, and if the bannerman stops using this presence, then the effect ends immediately (but the maneuver remains expended until recovered).
  
  The warlord must have the courageous defense class feature to select this tactical presence.

  The instructions given by the wary warlord help his allies defend themselves against sudden surprises. Allies within 30 feet of the warlord gain a bonus equal to the warlord's initiation modifier on Reflex saves against traps and to their AC during a surprise round. In addition, the warlord can designate one of his allies to act in a surprise round, even if they normally would not be able to.

text: '''
  The warlord is a driving master, be it cruelly with a whip or kindly with encouragement. Allies within 30 feet of the warlord gain the benefits of the Endurance feat and gain a morale bonus on saving throws against fatigue, disease, compulsion effects, and sleep effects equal to the warlord's initiation modifier. If the warlord is participating in a Craft or Profession check made by one of his allies, he can add his warlord initiation modifier as a morale bonus on that check.

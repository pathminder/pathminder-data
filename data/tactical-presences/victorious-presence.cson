minimum_level: 9
text: '''
  The preternatural skill at arms that a warlord of at this level possesses is enough to win any battle. Any foe that the warlord brings to 0 or fewer hit points in battle immediately fuels his hunger for the win, granting him and his allies within 30 feet of his position the character's class level plus Charisma modifier in temporary hit points. These hit points endure until they are lost or until the end of the encounter, whichever occurs first. Damage inflicted on the warlord is deducted from his temporary hit points first before being deducted from his normal hit point total.

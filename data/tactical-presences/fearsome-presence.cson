text: '''
  The bannerman's reputation in battle precedes him and an aura of his many victories inspires dread in his foes. Enemies of the bannerman within 30 ft. of his position are filled with dread as if under a *fear* spell (use the bannerman's Charisma modifier for the Will save DC and his initiator level as his caster level). Foes that succeed the saving throw are unaffected by the bannerman's fearsome presence for 24 hours.
  
  The warlord must have the courageous defense class feature to select this tactical presence.

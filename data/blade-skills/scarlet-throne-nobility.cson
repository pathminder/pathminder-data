  The war soul has mastered how to best use a single weapon to defend himself and read the actions of his opponents. While he maintains a Scarlet Throne stance and wields a mind blade in one hand while holding nothing in the other hand, the war soul gains a +1 dodge bonus to his AC and a +1 insight bonus on Sense Motive checks to resist feint attempts or oppose uses of the Bluff skill. These bonus increase by +1 at 5th level and every five levels thereafter.

  The soulknife must have the maneuvers class feature from the soulknife class to select this blade skill.

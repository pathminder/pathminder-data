text: '''
  When the soulknife expends his psionic focus to slow an enemy via the Ice Blade blade skill, if the slowed target is adjacent to the soulknife at the end of its next turn, its speed is reduced to 0 until the end of the soulknife's next turn. The soulknife must have the Ice Blade blade skill to choose this blade skill.

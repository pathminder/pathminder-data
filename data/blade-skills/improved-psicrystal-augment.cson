text: '''
  Magical or psionically enchanted weapons that possess special abilities that are not normally on the soulknife's enhanced mind blade list (such as bane) are temporarily added to that list for use by the augmented blade when using his psicrystal augment class feature, and the enhancement bonus applied to the weapon by that class feature increases by +1.

  The soulknife must have the psicrystal augment class feature to take this blade skill.

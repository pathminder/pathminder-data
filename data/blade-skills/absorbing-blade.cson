text: '''
  The soulknife may expend his psychic strike to have his mind blade absorb a spell, spell-like ability, power, or psi-like ability that would affect her. Effects that are not subjected to spell resistance or power resistance cannot be absorbed in this fashion. Effects that target an area or multiple targets are only absorbed for the soulknife; other affected targets are still affected normally. The level of the effect cannot exceed the number of dice of psychic strike expended. This blade skill may not be used with the mind bolt.

  The soulknife gains the ability to momentarily fragment his mind blade into numerous identical blades, each of which strikes at a nearby opponent.

  As a full attack, when wielding his mind blade, a soulknife can give up his regular attacks and instead fragment his mind blade to make one melee attack at his full base attack bonus against each opponent within reach. Each fragment functions identically to the soulknife's regular mind blade.

  When using bladewind, the soulknife can choose to expend his psychic strike if an attack miss to reroll that attack, but none of the bladewind attacks deal any extra damage from psychic strike.

  When using bladewind, a soulknife forfeits any bonus or extra attacks granted by other feats or abilities (such as Cleave or haste). The mind blade immediately reverts to its previous form after the bladewind attack.

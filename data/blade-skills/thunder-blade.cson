text: '''
  When the soulknife makes an attack with his mind blade, he can choose to have it deal sonic damage instead of its normal damage, although the damage of the attack is halved. In addition, the soulknife can expend his psionic focus when he hits with an attack to stagger the target until the end of his next turn unless the target makes a successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + the soulknife's base attack bonus).

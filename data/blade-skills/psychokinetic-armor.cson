  The soulknife may form mind armor as if she possessed the mind armaments class feature (see armored blade soulknife archetype); this only allows her to form mind armor from the mind armaments class feature (weapons must be formed from another ability). She may form the mind armor as a move action and remains until it is dismissed (free action) or until she is knocked unconscious or dead. She uses the mind armaments enhancement bonus from the armored blade archetype to determine the mind armor's enhancement bonus based on her soulknife level and may select armor special abilities from that archetype. As usual, whenever the soulknife forms multiple items, the enhancement bonus of all items she forms decrease by 1 per item formed after the first. She may also shape the form of her mind armor as if she possessed the shape mind armaments class feature (mind armor only). Unlike the mind armaments class feature of the armored blade, psychokinetic armor is not subject to the benefits of the Improved Enhancement blade skill. This functions otherwise in all ways as the mind armaments class feature for the purposes of prerequisites and requirements.

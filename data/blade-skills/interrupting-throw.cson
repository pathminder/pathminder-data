  If an enemy within 10 feet of the soulknife performs an action that would provoke an attack of opportunity, such as casting a spell without casting on the defensive, he may, as an immediate action and by expending psionic focus, throw his mind shield at that enemy as an attack of opportunity. The soulknife may not use this blade skill if his mind shield is in the form of a tower shield. The soulknife must have the form mind shield class feature to choose this blade skill.

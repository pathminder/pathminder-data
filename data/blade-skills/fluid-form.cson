  The soulknife may expend his psychic strike as a swift action, but deal no psychic strike damage, to make a minor modification to his mind blade. She may remove up to one weapon special ability (if any) from his mind blade's configuration, and add the ability's value to the mind blade's enhancement bonus. She may also add up to one weapon special ability to his mind blade's configuration, and subtract the ability's value from the mind blade's enhancement bonus. Once he had made either or both of these changes, the mind blade suffers a -1 penalty to its enhancement bonus; this penalty is cumulative with each time this blade skill is used, and lasts until the soulknife rests for 8 hours or spends 8 hours in concentration to reconfigure his mind blade. This blade skill may not be used if this would reduce the mind blade's enhancement bonus below +1, or if the final enhancement bonus would be above the soulknife's maximum.

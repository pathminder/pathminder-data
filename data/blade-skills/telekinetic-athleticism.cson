  The psionic energies of the soulknife's mind permeate her body, greatly enhancing her athletic prowess. She gains the benefits of the Mental Leap and Speed of Thought psionic feats while she maintains her psionic focus, and may expend her psychic strike's charge to fuel the secondary abilities of these feats instead of using her psionic focus.

  By placing his psicrystal to his armor, he may enhance his armor as he would enhance a weapon when using his psicrystal. See mind armaments class feature of the armored blade archetype to see the list of available armor special qualities that can be added to a suit of armor.

  The soulknife must have the psicrystal augment class feature to take this blade skill.

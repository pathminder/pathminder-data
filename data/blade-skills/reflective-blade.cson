text: '''
  A soulknife may expend his psychic strike as an immediate action to reflect a spell or power that would strike his back at the caster. The spell or power must be a touch attack spell or power, either ranged or melee, and the level of the spell or power reflected cannot exceed the number of dice of damage expended by psychic strike. The soulknife makes a ranged touch attack to determine if the spell successfully strikes the target.

  The soulknife must have the Absorbing Blade blade skill to select this blade skill.

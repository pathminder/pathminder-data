  The martial knowledge of the war soul supplements his ability to generate his mind blade. The war soul may manifest his mind blade into the shape of a weapon from a known discipline's associated weapon groups, and he may shift between these discipline forms as a move action or as part of a swift action when assuming a stance of that weapon's discipline. While in the shape of a discipline weapon, the mind blade functions exactly like that weapon and gains the weapons damage, damage type, special properties (such as brace or reach), and critical range and multiplier for a weapon sized appropriately for the war soul. The war soul is always considered to be proficient with his mind blade, regardless of its form. Ranged weapons that use ammunition generate their own standard ammunition out of the mind blade's current shape, or may use non-psychically generated ammunition as normal.

  The soulknife must have the maneuvers class feature from the soulknife class to take this blade skill.

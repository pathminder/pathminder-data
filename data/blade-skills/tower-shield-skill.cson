  The soulknife reduces the attack and armor check penalties by 1 (to a minimum of 0) if his mind shield is in tower shield form. The soulknife may take this blade skill multiple times, its effects stack. The soulknife must have the mind shield blade skill and the ability to shape his mind shield into a tower shield to choose this blade skill.

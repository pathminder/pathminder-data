  The soulknife may generate a temporary field of energy in the form of a heavy net of psychic power created from her mind blade. By throwing a mind blade at a target and expending his psionic focus, it rapidly expands into an ectoplasmic construct that envelops the target as if the soulknife had manifested the *entangling ectoplasm* psionic power (in lieu of causing damage from the thrown weapon). Treat this as a psi-like ability that uses the character's soulknife level as the effective manifester level of the power and the DC to break free of this net with a Strength check is Wisdom-based.

text: '''
  This works like evasion, except that while the soulknife still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless soulknife does not gain the benefit of improved evasion. A soulknife must have the Evasion blade skill and the Covert Training class feature before selecting this blade skill.

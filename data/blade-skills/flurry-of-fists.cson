text: '''
  When making unarmed attacks and making a full attack, the soulknife can make one additional attack at his highest attack bonus, but all attacks in the full attack suffer a -2 penalty to the attack roll. This extra attack does not stack with abilities that grant additional attacks, such as Two-Weapon Fighting, Flurry of Blows, or other such effects. The soulknife must have the Improved Unarmed Strike feat in order to select this blade skill.

  The soulknife can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the soulknife is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless soulknife does not gain the benefit of evasion. The soulknife must have the Covert Training class feature to select this blade skill.

  When the soulknife expends his psionic focus to damage an enemy via the Fire Blade blade skill, if the damaged target is adjacent to the soulknife at the end of its next turn, the soulknife deals 1d10 additional fire damage to it and each enemy within 10 feet of the damaged target. The soulknife must have the Fire Blade blade skill to choose this blade skill.

  The soulknife learns to manifest her mind bolt as a melee weapon in addition to its myriad of uses as a ranged one. Selection of this blade skill grants the form mind blade and throw mind blade class features. The soulknife is always considered proficient with her mind blade. The mind blade gains the enhancement bonus of the soulknife's mind bolt and may select its own enhancements (such as keen or flaming) as if it were a separate weapon from her mind bolt. The soulknife must have the form mind bolt class feature to select this blade skill.

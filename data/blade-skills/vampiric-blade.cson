text: '''
  The soulknife with knowledge of this art has learned that staying power is sometimes more important than a faster kill. Armed with this skill, the psychic strike of the soulknife's mind blade is capable of being a life-draining conduit to restore the vital energy of the wielder. When the soulknife expends her psychic strike ability on an attack against a living, corporeal creature she may choose to inflict only 1/2 her psychic strike damage and heal an equal amount of hit points.

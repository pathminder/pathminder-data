  The psychic armory is capable of driving her panoply of blades into the form of a temporary wall that can be used as cover and grants concealment, or total concealment if the character is completely sheltered behind the barrier using the total defense action. As a standard action, she expends her psionic focus and hardens her blades into a temporary shelter, forming a wall 10 feet long and 5 feet tall, with a hardness of 10 and 30 hit points. This depletes her entire panoply, and she may form her panoply of blades again on her next turn. The hardness and hit points of the wall is improved by the panoply's enhancement bonus. The wall lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + her Wisdom modifier.

  The soulknife must have the form panoply of blades class feature to select this blade skill.

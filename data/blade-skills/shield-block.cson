text: '''
  As an immediate action and by expending psionic focus, the soulknife may block one melee attack, but not touch attack, against his by making an attack roll. If his attack roll is higher than the attack roll he is attempting to block, the attack misses. The soulknife must have the form mind shield class feature to choose this blade skill.

  As a move action, the augmented blade can attach his psicrystal to a magic item that uses the spell trigger (e.g. wands, staffs) or power trigger (e.g. dorjes, psicrowns) activation methods, allowing him to add his Wisdom Modifier to Use Magic Device checks with that item in place of his Charisma modifier (if higher). When using that item to produce a spell or power effect, in place of expending a charge or power points from that item, he may choose to spend a number of his own power points equal to double the effect's spell or power level (e.g. using a *wand of fireball*, a 3rd-level spell, would require 6 pp); if he does so, then he may use his class level in place of the effect's normal caster level or manifester level, and may calculate its saving throw DCs using his Wisdom modifier instead of the minimum modifier needed to cast a spell or power of that level. If manifesting a psionic power from the item, then he may expend additional power points to augment that power as normal. In the case of a spell from a staff which normally requires multiple charges to use, this ability reduces the number of charges required to cast that spell by one---this reduction does not stack with itself.

  The soulknife must have the psicrystal augment class feature to take this blade skill.

text: '''
  With this blade skill, the soulknife is capable of channeling her psychic strike damage into caustic, anti-psionic energy. As a standard action, the soulknife can expend her psionic focus and her psionic strike to make an attack with her mind blade (or equivalent weapon). If it hits, it deals weapon damage as normal, and the soulknife affects the target with a targeted *dispel psionics* power as a psi-like ability, with a manifester level equal to her class level. The soulknife does not apply the expended psychic strike's damage to her attack.

  The deadly mystery of the Veiled Moon shadows the actions of these war souls, and aids them in their understanding of the discipline. While in a Veiled Moon stance, the character may choose to use his Wisdom modifier in place of his Dexterity modifier when using the Stealth skill and gains the hide in plain sight special ability.

  The soulknife must have the maneuvers class feature from the soulknife class to take this blade skill.

  The psychic armory directs her panoply into a teeming barrage of cutting shards of psychic fury. She expends her psionic focus and as a standard action, she directs her weapons to become a 60-foot line of cutting blades that inflicts 1d6 points of slashing and piercing damage per psychic armory level, plus the enhancement bonus of the psychic armory's panoply of blades to all targets along its path. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 the psychic armory's class level + the psychic armory's Wisdom modifier) halves this damage. This attack is subject to damage reduction as normal. This uses all of her blades for the round and they return to her panoply the following round. If the psychic armory possessed an energy-based blade skill (such as Fire Blade), the psychic armory may choose to deal 1/2 this damage as energy damage of the same type as the energy-based blade skill of her choice.

  The soulknife must have the form panoply of blades class feature to select this blade skill.

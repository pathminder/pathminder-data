  The soulknife's mind armor improves depending on its form. Light form is treated as if not wearing armor, while still gaining the armor bonus to Armor Class. Medium form is treated as a masterwork breastplate. Heavy form is treated as masterwork full plate. The soulknife must have the ability to form mind armor in order to take this blade skill.

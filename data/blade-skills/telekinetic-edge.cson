text: '''
  The soulknife's mind blade can be honed to such a sharp edge that it can pass through a foe's defenses and strike at the softer and more vital bits inside. While psionically focused, the soulknife may expend her psychic strike charge as a free action to ignore a target's damage reduction or an object's hardness until her next turn instead of inflicting additional damage.

  When a soulknife is fighting defensively, or using the Combat Expertise feat, with a mind blade, and an opponent misses his in melee, he may expend his psionic focus to make an attack of opportunity against that opponent with his mind blade. The soulknife ignores the penalty to attack rolls from fighting defensively for this attack.

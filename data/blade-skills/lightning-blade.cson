text: '''
  When the soulknife makes an attack with his mind blade, he can choose to have it deal electricity damage instead of its normal damage. In addition, the soulknife can expend his psionic focus when he hits with an attack to give the target a --2 penalty to attack and damage rolls until the end of his next turn. If the target is wearing metal armor, the penalty increases to --3.

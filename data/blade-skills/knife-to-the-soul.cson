  The soulknife gains the knife to the soul ability. When a soulknife with knife to the soul executes a psychic strike, he can choose to substitute Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma damage (her choice) for extra dice of damage. For each die of extra damage he gives up, he deals 1 point of damage to the ability score he chooses. A soulknife can combine extra dice of damage and ability damage in any combination, so long as no more than half of the soulknife's extra dice of damage are converted to ability damage. Knife to the soul may only be used once per round.

  Unlike the base psychic strike ability, knife to the soul is entirely reliant on the creature's mind, and cannot be used on creatures immune to mind-affecting abilities. The soulknife decides which ability score his psychic strike damages and the division of ability damage and extra dice of damage when he imbues his mind blade with the psychic strike energy.

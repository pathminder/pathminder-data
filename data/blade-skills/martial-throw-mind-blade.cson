text: '''
  A mind blade is the perfect expression of a war soul's martial talent and desire for a perfect weapon. With a mighty throw and a powerful will empowering it, the character may expend his psionic focus while throwing his mind blade to initiate a martial maneuver with a range of melee as a ranged attack instead, and resolve the maneuver as per normal at close range (25 ft. plus 5 ft. per 2 initiator levels).

  The soulknife must have the maneuvers class feature from the soulknife class to take this blade skill.

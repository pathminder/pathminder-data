  While maintaining psionic focus and manifesting his mind blade, the war soul's combat intuition focuses him towards the deadly end that the Broken Blade adherent pushes for. While in a Broken Blade stance, the character gains a +1 dodge bonus to his AC for every five class levels (minimum of +1), and may use his Wisdom modifier in place of his Dexterity modifier when using the Acrobatics skill or making a Reflex save. The war soul must be wearing medium or lighter armor.

  The soulknife must have the maneuvers class feature from the soulknife class to take this blade skill.

text: '''
  The soulknife who possesses this blade skill is capable of splitting his mind blade further than others of his kind due to having more than two limbs capable of wielding a weapon. Limbs capable of wielding mind blades after the first two can be armed with light weapon versions of her mind blade; just as when using shape mind blade to create multiple mind blades, the enhancement bonus is reduced by one for these blades as well. The soulknife must possess three or more hands (or their equivalent) to select this blade skill.

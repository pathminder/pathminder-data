  The soulknife gains the ability to have a separate configuration for his mind blade's enhancement bonus and special abilities. When he forms his mind blade, the soulknife may choose either configuration. Creating this extra configuration functions just as reassigning the enhancement of his mind blade, typically 8 hours of concentration, and when the soulknife reassigns his mind blade configuration, he must reassign each configuration separately, taking the normal 8 hours of concentration per configuration. Additionally, the soulknife may configure the off-hand light weapon form of his mind blade separately from the main hand configuration, if he chooses to form two mind blades and spends the normal 8 hours of concentration. The off-hand mind blade in both configurations can be separately configured in this way. If a soulknife with a separate off-hand configuration forms a one-handed or two-handed mind blade, it always uses the current configuration set for the main hand, never the off-hand configuration.

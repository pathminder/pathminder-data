  The soulknife can form his mind blade to replicate any single melee weapon, chosen at the time he takes this blade skill. The soulknife is proficient with his mind blade in this form and it functions in all ways as the chosen weapon. This blade skill may be taken multiple times; each time, it allows the soulknife to form his mind blade to replicate a different melee weapon. This blade skill may not be used with the mind bolt.

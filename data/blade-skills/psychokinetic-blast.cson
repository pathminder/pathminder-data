text: '''
  The soulknife may cause her psychic strike to explode out from her target into a sudden burst of psychokinetic energy. When making an attack, the soulknife expends her psychic strike to deal her psychic strike damage to her target as well as all adjacent creatures to the target (excluding the soulknife).

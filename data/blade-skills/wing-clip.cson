  As a standard action, the soulknife may make a single melee attack against a single creature. If he hits, instead of dealing damage, the vibrations in his mind blade damages the creature's ability to move, rendering it unable to move for a number of rounds equal to the soulknife's Strength modifier (minimum 1). A successful Fortitude save negates the effect. The DC of this save is 10 + the soulknife's base attack bonus.

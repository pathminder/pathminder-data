  The soulknife's Psychic Net gains new versatility, gaining the ability to reel her opponent in towards her reach: or she can use this connection to her psychic net to vault herself towards her target instead. This functions as as a psi-like ability of the power *ectoplasmic grapnel* using the character's soulknife level as her manifester level. When using this blade skill, the soulknife may substitute her Wisdom score for her Strength score when making CMB checks for this ability. If choosing to launch herself towards her target, she may move along her connection to the target as a free action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity due to how swiftly she moves. The soulknife must possess the Psychic Net blade skill in order to select this blade skill.

  By concentrating her mind blade down into tiny slivers of hardened thought, the soulknife can create tools with which to perform a variety of tasks that she otherwise would need to use specialized tools for. With this blade skill, the soulknife may manifest her mind blade into different tools (artisans tools, a blanket, a mess kit, a thief's toolkit, a 10-foot. pole, the form of a 50-foot silk rope with grappling hook, or more with GM discretion) as a move action. These tools add the mind blade's enhancement bonus as a competence bonus on skill checks when using these tools, and if relevant they possess the standard hardness, hit points, and break DC of items of these types. The soulknife must maintain contact with these tools for them to remain cohesive. Upon reaching 5th level, these tools can be generated as a swift action.

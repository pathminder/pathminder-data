  When the soulknife expends his psionic focus to penalize an enemy via the Lightning Blade blade skill, if the penalized target is adjacent to the soulknife at the end of its next turn, it is dazzled for one round and another enemy within 30 feet of the target takes 3d6 electricity damage. A successful Reflex Save (DC 10 + the soulknife's base attack bonus) halves the damage taken.

  The soulknife must have the lightning blade blade skill to choose this blade skill.
